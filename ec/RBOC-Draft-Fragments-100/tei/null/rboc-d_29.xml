  <lb/>tiny hill in front of him. They used stones, earth and any-
  <lb/>thing they thought would turn a bullet. Some built
  <lb/>comparatively large ones while others seemed content with
  <lb/>little ones. In a short time, there was quite a barricade
  <lb/>along the regimental front. Directly, however, they re-
  <lb/>cieved orders to withdraw from that place.
  <lb/>This astounded Fleming. He forgot his stewing over
  <lb/>the advance movement. "Well, then, what did they march
  <lb/>us out here fer?" he demanded of Jim Conklin. The
  <lb/>latter with calm faith began a ponderous explan-
  <lb/>ation. Fleming scoffed at him.
  <lb/>When the brigade was aligned in another position,
  <lb/>each man's care for his safety caused another barricade
  <lb/>to be erected created. They were moved from this one
  <lb/>also. They ate their none noon meal behind a third one. They
  <lb/>were marched about from place to place with apparent
  <lb/>aimlessness.
  <lb/>Fleming grew feverishly impatient. He considered
  <lb/>that there was denoted a lack of purpose on the part of
  <lb/>the generals. He began to complain to Jim Conklin. "I
  <lb/>can't stand this much longer," he cried. "I don't see
  <lb/>what good it does to make us jest wear out'r legs fer
  <lb/>nothin'."
  <lb/>The philosophical Conklin measured a sandwhich
  <lb/>of cracker and pork and engulfed in a nonchalant man-
  <lb/>ner. "Oh, I s'pose we must go reconnoiterin' aroun' th'
  <lb/>kentry jest t' keep 'em from gittin' too clost, or, t' dev-
  <lb/>elope 'em, or somethin'."
  <lb/>"Huh," said Wilson.
