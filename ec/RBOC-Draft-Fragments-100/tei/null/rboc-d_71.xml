  <lb/>"Well, he was a reg'lar jim-dandy fer nerve, w'a'nt 
  <lb/>he?" he said he finally in a little, awe-struck voice. 
  <lb/>"A reg'lar jim-dandy, he was."
  <lb/>He thoughtfully pushed one of the dead hands with his 
  <lb/>toe. "I wonder where he got 'is stren'th from. I never 
  <lb/>seen a man do like that before. It was a curious thing. 
  <lb/>Well, he was a reg'lar jim-dandy."
  <lb/>Fleming desired to screech out his grief. He was 
  <lb/>stabbed. But his tongue lay dead in the tomb of 
  <lb/>his mouth. He threw himself upon the ground and 
  <lb/>began to brood.
  <lb/>The tattered man stood musing.
  <lb/>"Look-a-here, pardner," he said after a time. 
  <lb/>He regarded the corpse as he spoke. "He's up an' gone, 
  <lb/>aint, 'e, an' we might as well begin t' look out fer 
  <lb/>ol' number one. He's all right. Nobody won't bother' 
  <lb/>'im. An' I must say I aint enjoyin' any great health
  <lb/>m'self these days."
  <lb/>Fleming, awakened by the tattered soldier's tone, 
  <lb/>looked quickly up. He saw that he saw swinging 
  <lb/>uncertainly on his legs and that his face had 
  <lb/>turned a blue shade.
  <lb/>"Good Lord," he cried. "You aint goin' t'--not 
  <lb/>you, too?"
  <lb/>The tattered soldier waved his hand. "Nary die," 
  <lb/>he said. "All I want is some pea-soup an' a 
  <lb/>good bed. Some pea-soup," he repeated dreamily.
