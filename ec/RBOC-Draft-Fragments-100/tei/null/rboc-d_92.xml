  <lb/>a moment, and then fall again. His face was of a 
  <lb/>clammy pallor. Deep groans were wrenched from him.
  <lb/>At last with a twisting movement he got upon
  <lb/>his hands and knees <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_92_z019">afrom</del>and from thence, like a

  <lb/>-ing over the grass.
  <lb/>And afterward, Fleming fought an intense 
  <lb/>fight with his body. His dulled senses wished him 
  <lb/>to swoon and he opposed them stubbornly, his mind 
  <lb/>picturing unknown dangers and mutilations if he 
  <lb/>fell upon the field. He went forward, Conklin-fash
  <lb/>-ion.He thought of secluded spots where he could 
  <lb/>fall and be unmolested. To reach <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_92_z015">them</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_92_z014">one</add>, he strove
  <lb/>against the tide of his pain.
  <lb/>He put his hand up to his head and timidly
  <lb/>touched the wound under his hair. The scratching
  <lb/>pain of the contact made him draw a long breath 
  <lb/>through his clenched teeth. His fingers were dabbled 
  <lb/>with blood. He regarded them with a fixed stare.
  <lb/>Around him, he could hear the grumble of jolt
  <lb/>-ing batteries as the <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_92_z010">rumming</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_92_z011">scurrying</add> horses were lashed toward  
  <lb/>the front. Once a young officer on a be-splashed 
  <lb/>charger near ran him down. He turned and watched 
  <lb/>the artilleryman controlling the mass of cannon, men,
  <lb/>and horses by excited motions of his gauntleted hand.
  <lb/>The guns followed the teams with <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_92_z012">and</del><add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_92_z013">a seeming</add> air of
