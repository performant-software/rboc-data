  <lb/>swallow the whole cammand. He glared about him as if hunted.
  <lb/>He thought that he must break from the ranks and
  <lb/>harangue his comrades. They must not all be killed like pigs.
  <lb/>And he was sure it would be so. And he was sure it would
  <lb/>be so. The general were idiots to send them marching
  <lb/>into a regular pen. He would step forth and make
  <lb/>a speech. Shrill and passionate words were at his lips.
  <lb/>The line broken into moving fragments by the
  <lb/>ground went calmly on through fields and woods.
  <lb/>Fleming looked at the men nearest him and saw
  <lb/>for the most part, expressions of deep interest as if they
  <lb/>were investigating something that had fascinated them.
  <lb/>Some stepped with an over-valiant air as if they were
  <lb/>already plunged into war. Others went as upon thin
  <lb/>ice. The greater part of the untested men seemed appeared
  <lb/>quiet and absorbed.
  <lb/>As he looked, Fleming gripped his out-cry at
  <lb/>his throat. He saw that even if they were tottering
  <lb/>with fear they would laugh at his oration. They
  <lb/>would jeer him and, if practicable, pelt him with
  <lb/>missiles. Admitting that he might be wrong, a
  <lb/>frenzied declamation of the kind would turn him
  <lb/>into a worm.
  <lb/>He assumed the demeanor of one who is doomed, a-
  <lb/>knows that he is doomed, alone, to unwritten responsibilities.
  <lb/>Presently, the brigade was halted in the cathedral-
  <lb/>light of a forest. The busy skirmishers were still
  <lb/>popping. Through the aisles of the wood could be
  <lb/>seen the floating smoke from their rifles.
