  <lb/>the village street at home before the arrival of the cir-
  <lb/>cus parade. He remembered how he <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_39_z013">had</add> stood a small
  <lb/>thrillful boy<del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_39_z018">.</del>, prepared to follow the band or the
  <lb/>dingy lady upon the white <restore change="dstX" hand="#SC" facs="#rboc-d_39_z014">s.h</restore>orse. He saw the
  <lb/>yellow road, the lines of expectant people, and
  <lb/>the sober houses. He remembered an old fellow
  <lb/>who used to sit upon a cracker-box in front of
  <lb/>the store and fiegn to despise such exhibitions.
  <lb/>Some one cried: "Hear they come."
  <lb/>There was a rustling and muttering among
  <lb/>the men. They displayed a feverish desire to have
  <lb/><del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_39_z006">everything</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_39_z006">all their munitions</add> ready to their hands. Cartridge-boxes
  <lb/>were adjusted with great care. It was as if seven
  <lb/>hundred new bonnets were being <subst facs="#rboc-d_39_z015"><del rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_39_z015">s</del><add place="inline" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_39_z015">t</add></subst>ried on. Gun-
  <lb/>locks clicked.
  <lb/>Jim Conklin, having prepared himself, produced
  <lb/>a red handkerchief. He was engaged in knotting
  <lb/>it accurately about his throat when the cry was
  <lb/>repeated up and down the line: "Here they come!
  <lb/>Here they come!"
  <lb/>Across the smoke-infested fields came a brown
  <lb/>bunch of running men who were giving shrill yells.
  <lb/>They came on stooping and swinging their rifles
  <lb/>at all angles. A flag, tilted forward, sped
  <lb/>near the front.
  <lb/>As he caught sight of them, Fleming was
  <lb/>suddenly smitten with the <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_39-0001">chanc</del> thought
  <lb/>that perhaps his rifle <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_39_z009">wasn</del> was not loaded.
