  <lb/>Fleming was silent for a time. At last, he spoke
  <lb/>to Conklin. "Jim!"
  <lb/>"What?"
  <lb/>"How d' yeh think th' regiment'll do?"
  <lb/>"Oh, they'll fight all right, I guess, after they once
  <lb/>git inteh it," said Conklin with a fine use of the third person.
  <lb/>"There's been more or less fun made of 'em, 'cause they're
  <lb/>new, a' course, an' all that, but they'll fight good enough, I guess."
  <lb/>"Think any th' boys'ill run?" persisted Fleming.
  <lb/>"Oh, there maya few of 'em run but there's
  <lb/>them kind in ev'ry reg'ment, 'specially when they first
  <lb/>goes under fire," said Conklin in a tolerant way. "Of

  <lb/>Most of th' boys'll fight like sin after-they-onct-

  <lb/>on the four last words.
  <lb/>"Oh, you think you know--" began Wilson with
  <lb/>scorn.
  <lb/>Conklin turned wrathfully upon him. They called
  <lb/>each other names.
  <lb/>Fleming interrupted them. "Did yeh ever think
