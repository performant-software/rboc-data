  <lb/>vacantly. He stared at Fleming for a moment. At 
  <lb/>last, he spoke: "Oh, inteh th' fields? Oh!"
  <lb/>He went blindly through the grass. Fleming turning 
  <lb/>to look at the lashing riders and jouncing guns of the 
  <lb/>battery was startled from his view by a cry from the 
  <lb/>tattered soldier.
  <lb/>"Great Gawd, he's runnin'!"
  <lb/>Looking about swiftly, Fleming saw his friend run-
  <lb/>ning in a staggering and stumbling way toward a 
  <lb/>little clump of bushes. His heart almost wrenched it-
  <lb/>self from his body at the sight. He made a noise 
  <lb/>of infinite pain and started in pursuit.
  <lb/>There was a grotesque race.
  <lb/>When he overtook Conklin he began to beg him 
  <lb/>with all the words he could find. "Jim--Jim--what 
  <lb/>are yeh doin'--what makes yeh do this way--y<subst facs="#rboc-d_68-0003"><del rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_68-0003">ou</del><add place="inline" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_68-0003">eh</add></subst>'ll
  <lb/>hurt yerself."
  <lb/>The same mysterious purpose was in Conklin's 
  <lb/>face. He protested dully. "No--no--don't tech me-
  <lb/>leave me be--leave me be"--
  <lb/>Fleming fiiled with wonder at the idea which 
  <lb/>seemed to absorb his friend<del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_68_z004">.</del><add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_68_z004">,</add> began quaveringly to 
  <lb/>question him. "Where yeh goin', Jim? What <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_68-0005">are</del>
  <lb/>yeh thinkin' about? What yeh tryin' t' do? Where 
  <lb/>yeh goin?"
  <lb/>Conklin faced about as upon a relentless 
  <lb/>pursuer. In his eyes, there was an appeal. 
  <lb/>"Leave me be, won't yeh? Leave me be!"
