  <lb/>the hole. Young Wilson followed. They were wrangling.
  <lb/>"That's all right," said Conklin waving his
  <lb/>hand impressively as he entered. "Yeh kin b'lieve
  <lb/>me er not--jest as yeh like. All yeh got t' do is
  <lb/>t' sit down an' wait as quiet as yeh kin. Then
  <lb/>pretty soon yeh'Il find out I was right."
  <lb/>Young Wilson grumbled stubbornly. "Well,
  <lb/>yeh don't <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_12_z007">know</add><metamark place="inline" function="caret" rend="ink" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_12_z008">^</metamark> everything in th' world, do yeh?"
  <lb/>"Didn't say I knew everything in th' world,"
  <lb/>replied Conklin sharply. He dumped <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_12_z004">everything</del> <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_12_z003">the contents</add>

  <lb/>began to stow the things skilfully in again.
  <lb/>Fleming looked down at the busy figure. "Goin'
  <lb/>t' be a battle sure, is there, Jim?" he asked.
  <lb/>"Of course," said Conklin. "Of course! Yeh
  <lb/>jest wait 'til t'morrah an' yeh'll see th' bigges'
  <lb/>battle ever was. Yeh jest wait."
  <lb/>"Thunder," said Fleming.
  <lb/>"Oh, yeh'll see figh tin' this time, m' boy, what'ill
  <lb/>be reg'lar fightin'," added Conklin with the air of a
  <lb/>man who is about to exhibit a battle for the bene-
  <lb/>fit of his friends.
  <lb/>"Huh," said Wilson from a corner.
  <lb/>"Well," remarked Fleming, "like as not this here
  <lb/>story will turn out jest like them others did."
  <lb/>"Not much it won't," replied Conklin with exasper-
  <lb/>ation. "Th<del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_12_z002">e</del><add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_12_z016">'</add> cavalry all started this morning, they
  <lb/>say. They say there aint hardly no <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_12_z001">cala</del> cavalry
  <lb/>left in camp. Th' reg'ments got orders, too. I seen
  <lb/>'em go t' head-quarters. Besides, they're raisin' blazes all
  <lb/>over camp--anybody kin see that."
