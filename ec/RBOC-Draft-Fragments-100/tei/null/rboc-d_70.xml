  <lb/>that gradually enveloped him. For a moment,
  <lb/>the tremor of his legs made him dance a sort of a
  <lb/>hideous horn-pipe. His arms beat wildly about his
  <lb/>head. His tall figure grew <metamark place="inline" function="caret" rend="ink" change="dStX" facs="#rboc-d_70_z007">^</metamark><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_70_z005">suddenly</add> to <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_70_z006">sudden</del> unnatural
  <lb/>proportions then it began to swing slowly forward

  <lb/>caused the left shoulder to <metamark place="inline" function="caret" rend="ink" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_70_z007">^</metamark><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_70_z008">first</add> strike the ground<add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_70_z010">.</add> <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_70_z009">fir</del>
  <lb/>The body seemed to bounce a little way from
  <lb/>the earth. "Gawd," said the tattered soldier.
  <lb/>Fleming had watched, spell-bound, these
  <lb/>rites of a departing life, this dance of death.
  <lb/>His face had been twisted into every form of agony
  <lb/>that he had imagined for his friend.
  <lb/>He now sprang to his <subst facs="#rboc-d_70_z014"><del rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_70_z014">a</del><add place="inline" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_70_z014">feet</add></subst> and gazed at
  <lb/>the paste-like face. The mouth was open and
  <lb/>the teeth showed in a laugh.
  <lb/>As the flap of the blue jacket fell away
  <lb/>from the body, he could see that the side
  <lb/>looked as if it had been chewed by wolves.
  <lb/>Fleming turned toward the battle ground. His
  <lb/>hands were clenched<del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_70_z011">.</del> and a rage was upon his
  <lb/>face. He seemed about to deliver a phillipic.
