  <lb/>he had never been obliged to grapple too seriously
  <lb/>with the question. He had taken certain
  <lb/>things for granted, even as in thoughts about
  <lb/>his life, he had never <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_11_z005">had</add><metamark place="inline" function="caret" rend="ink" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_11_z006">^</metamark> doubts of the ultimate
  <lb/>success of it and had bothered little about
  <lb/>means and roads.
  <lb/>But he was now suddenly confronted. As
  <lb/>his imagination went forward to a fight, he
  <lb/>saw hideous possibilities. He contemplated the
  <lb/>lurking menaces of the future and failed in
  <lb/>an effort to see himself standing stoutly
  <lb/>in the midst of them. He recalled his <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_11_z007">sha</del>
  <lb/>visions of broken-bladed glory but in the sha-
  <lb/>dow of the impending tumult, he suspected

  <lb/>He sprang from his bunk and began to
  <lb/>pace nervously up and down the floor. "Good
  <lb/>Gawd, what's the matter with me," he cried to
  <lb/>himself.
  <lb/>He felt that his laws of life were
  <lb/>useless. Whatever he had learned of him-
  <lb/>self was now of no consequence. He was

  <lb/>liged to experiment, as he had in early youth,
  <lb/>and get upon his guard, else those qualities
  <lb/>of which he knew nothing might everlastingly
  <lb/>disgrace him. "Good Gawd," he repeated.
