  <lb/>stand near the colonel of the 304th. He shook his
  <lb/>fist in the latter's face. "<subst facs="#rboc-d_40_z009"><del rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_40_z009">x</del><add place="inline" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_40_z009">Y</add></subst>ou've got t' hold 'em back,"
