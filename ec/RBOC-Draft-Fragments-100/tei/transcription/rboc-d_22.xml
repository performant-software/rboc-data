  <lb/>He looked into the future with clear proud eye.
  <lb/>"You're goin' t' do great things, I s'pose?" said
  <lb/>Fleming.
  <lb/>Wilson blew a dignified cloud of smoke in-
  <lb/>to the air. "Oh, I don't know," he remarked,
  <lb/>thoughtfully, "I don't know. I s'pose I'll do as
  <lb/>well as th' rest. I'm goin' t' try t', like thunder."
  <lb/>"How d'yeh know yeh won't run when th' time
  <lb/>comes," asked Fleming.
  <lb/>"'Run',?" said Wilson. "'Run'? Of course not."
  <lb/>"Well," continued Fleming, "lots of good 'nough
  <lb/>men have thought they was goin' t' do great things
  <lb/>'fore th' fight but when th' time come, they skedaddled."
  <lb/>"Oh, well, that's all true enough," said Wilson
  <lb/>with great assurance, "but I'm not goin' t' skedaddle.
  <lb/>Th' man that bets on my runnin' will lose his mon-
  <lb/>ey that's all." He wagged his head with much self-

  <lb/>"Oh, shucks," said Fleming. "Yeh aint th'
  <lb/>bravest man in th' world, are yeh?"
  <lb/>"No, I aint," replied Wilson, savagely, "An' I
  <lb/>didn't say I was th' bravest man in th' world,
  <lb/>neither. I said I was going t' do my share
  <lb/>of fightin'--that's what I said. An' I am,
  <lb/>too." He glared angrily at Fleming too
  <lb/>for a moment and then arose and
  <lb/>strode away with an air of offended
  <lb/>pride.
