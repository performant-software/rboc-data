He thought of the magnificent pathos of his dead body.
  <lb/>He was up-lifted. He felt the quiver of <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_79_z018">a rapid,</del>

  <lb/>frenzy of a rapid, successful charge. The music of the 
  <lb/>trampling feet, the sharp voices, and the clanking 
  <lb/>arms of the column made him soar on the red wings 
  <lb/>of war.

  <lb/>He thought that he was about to start fleetly 
  <lb/>for the front. Then the difficulties of the thing began 
  <lb/>to drag at him. He hesitated, balancing awkwardly 
  <lb/>on one foot.
  <lb/>He had no rifle; he could not fight with 
  <lb/>his hands. Well, rifles could be had for the picking.
  <lb/>Also, it would be miraculous if he found his 
  <lb/>regiment. Well, he could fight with any regiment.
  <lb/>He started forward slowly. He stepped as if he 
  <lb/>expected to tread upon <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_79_z023">some</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_79_z024">an</add> explosive thing. Doubts 
  <lb/>and he were struggling.
  <lb/>He would truly be a worm if any of them should 
  <lb/>see him returning thus, the marks of his flight upon 
  <lb/>him. He replied that the intent fighters did not care 
  <lb/>for what happened rear-w<subst facs="#rboc-d_79_z025"><del rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_79_z025">o</del><add place="inline" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_79_z025">a</add></subst>rd saving that no hostile
