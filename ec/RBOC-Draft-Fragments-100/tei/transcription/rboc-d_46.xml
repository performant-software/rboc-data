He came gradually back to a 
  <lb/>position from which he could regard himself. For moments, 
  <lb/>he had been scrutinizing <del rend="overwrite ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_46_z008">he</del>his person in a dazed way as if he 
  <lb/>had never seen himself before. Then he picked up his 
  <lb/>cap from the ground. He wriggled in his jacket to make 
  <lb/>a more comfortable fit and kneeling down laced his shoe. 
  <lb/>He thoughtfully moped his reeking features.
  <lb/>So it was all over. He went into an ecstasy of self-satis-
  <lb/>faction. He had the most delightful sensations of his life. Stand-
  <lb/>ing as if apart from himself, he viewed the late scene<del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_46_z001">s</del>. He 
  <lb/>percieved that the man who had fought thus was magnificent.
  <lb/>He felt that he was a fine fellow. He saw him-
  <lb/>self even with those ideals which he had considered 
  <lb/>as being far beyond him. He smiled with deep grati-
  <lb/>fication. <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_46_z003">on his fellows</del> He beamed good-will and ten-
  <lb/>derness on his fellows.
  <lb/>"Gee, aint it hot, eh?" he said affably to a 
  <lb/>man who was polishing his <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_46_z005">face</del><del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_46_z006"/> streaming face with 
  <lb/>his coat-sleeve. 
  <lb/>"You bet," said the other grinning sociably. "I 
  <lb/>never seen sech dumb hotness." He <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_46_z007">sp</del> sprawled 
  <lb/>out luxuriously on the ground. "I hope we 
  <lb/>don't have no more fightin' til -- 'til a week
  <lb/>from Monday."
  <lb/>There were some hand-shakings and deep speeches 
  <lb/>with men whose features only were familar but with 
  <lb/>whom Fleming now felt the bonds of tied hearts. He 
  <lb/>helped a cursing comrade to bind up a wound 
  <lb/>of the shin.
