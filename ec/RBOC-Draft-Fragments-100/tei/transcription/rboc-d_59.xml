  <lb/>bur�nished sun sank until slanted bronze rays struck 
  <lb/>the tree-tops. There was a lull in the noise of insects 
  <lb/>as if they had bowed their beaks and were making a 
  <lb/>devotional pause. There was silence save for the chanted
  <lb/>chorus of the trees.
  <lb/>Upon this stillness there suddenly broke a tre-
  <lb/>mendous clangor of sounds. A crimson roar came from the distance.
  <lb/>Fleming paused. He was transfixed by this terrific medley
  <lb/>of all noises. It was as if worlds were being rended. The
  <lb/>ripping of musketry was mingled with the breaking 
  <lb/>crash of the <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_59_z001"><metamark place="inline" function="foliation" rend="ink" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_59_z001">artillery</metamark></del> cannon.
  <lb/>His mind flew in all directions. He concieved
  <lb/>the two armies to be at each other panther-wise. He 
  <lb/>listened for a time. Then he began to run in the dir-
  <lb/>ection of the battle. He saw that it was an ironical 
  <lb/>thing for him to be running thus toward that which 
  <lb/>he had been at such pains to avoid. But he said,

  <lb/>and moon were about to clash together, many would
  <lb/>plan to get upon roofs to witness the collision.
  <lb/>As he ran, he was aware that the forest had 
  <lb/>stopped it's music as if at last becoming capable of
  <lb/>hearing the foriegn sounds. The trees hushed and 
  <lb/>bended forward. Everything seemed to be listening 
  <lb/>to the crackle and <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_59_z003"><metamark place="inline" function="foliation" rend="ink" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_59_z003">clamo</metamark></del> clatter of the infantry fir-
  <lb/>ing and the ear-shaking thunder of the artillery. 
  <lb/>The chorus pealed over the still earth.
