<lb/>When he had finished, the blue-clothed men scattered

<lb/>a steel-glitter. Smoke drifted lazily from bar-
<lb/>rel-chimneys.
<lb/>"It's a lie—that's all it is. A thunderin' lie,"
<lb/>said young Wilson. His smooth face was flushed
<lb/>and his hands were thrust sulkily into his trouser's
<lb/>pockets. He took the matter as a personal affront.
<lb/>"I don't believe th' derned ol' army's ever goin' t' move.
<lb/>We're sot. I've got ready t' move eight times in th' last
<lb/>two weeks an' we aint moved yit."
<lb/>Conklin felt called upon to defend the truth of
<lb/>a rumor he had introduced. He and <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_02_z031">f</del> young Wilson
<lb/>came near to fighting over it.
<lb/>Simpson, a corporal, began to swear. He had
<lb/>just put a costly board-floor in his house, he said.
<lb/>He had refrained from adding extensively to the
<lb/>comfort of his environment during the spring be-
<lb/>cause he had felt that the army might <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_02_z032">move</del>
<lb/>start on the march at any moment. Lately,
<lb/>however, he had been impressed that they were in
<lb/>a sort of eternal camp. So, he and his two mates
<lb/>had put in a board-floor! And now the
<lb/>army was going to move<subst facs="#rboc-d_02_z034"><del rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_02_z034">.</del><add place="inline" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_02_z034">!</add></subst>!

Some tin dishes lay on a
  <lb/>small pile of fire-wood. Equipments were hung
  <lb/>on handy projections. The smoke from the fire
  <lb/>at times neglected the clay-chimney and wreathed
  <lb/>into the room. A small window shot an ob-
  <lb/>lique square of light upon the cluttered floor.
  <lb/>So, they were at last going to fight. On
  <lb/>the morrow, perhaps, there would be a battle and
  <lb/>he would be in it.
  <lb/>He could not convince himself of it. It
  <lb/>was too strange. He could not believe with assurance
  <lb/>that he was at last to mingle in one of those great
  <lb/>affairs of the earth.
  <lb/>He had dreamed of battles all his life--
  <lb/>of vague, bloody conflicts that had thrilled
  <lb/>him with their sweep and fire. In visions, he
  <lb/>had seen himself in many struggles. But, awake,
  <lb/>he <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_04_z008">had</add> regarded battles as crimson blotches on

  <lb/>There was a portion of the world's history which
  <lb/>he had regarded as the time of war, but, that,
  <lb/>he had thought, had gone over the horizon
  <lb/>and disappeared forever. 
  <lb/>From his home, his youthful eyes had looked
  <lb/>at the war in his own country with distrust.
</ab><milestone n="5" unit="leaf"/><pb facs="#rboc-d_05"/><ab>
<lb/>It must be a sort of a play affair. Greek-like
<lb/>struggles could be no more, he had said. Men
<lb/>were better. Secular and religious education
<lb/>had effaced the throat-grappling instinct. 
<lb/>He had burned several times to enlist. His
<lb/>mother had, however, discouraged him. She had
<lb/>affected to look with some contempt upon
<lb/>the quality of his patriotism. She could calm-
<lb/>ly seat herself and with no trouble at all,
<lb/>give him nearly a thousand reasons why he
<lb/>was of more importance on the farm than
<lb/>on the field of battle. And she had had certain
<lb/>ways of expression that told that her state-
<lb/>ments on the subject came from a deep convict-
<lb/>ion.
<lb/>At last, he had rebelled against this
<lb/>yellow light thrown upon the color of his
<lb/>ambitions. The newspapers, the gossip of the
<lb/>village, his own picturings, had aroused him
<lb/>to an uncheckable degree. They were truly
<lb/>fighting down there. Almost every day, the
<lb/>country vibrated with the noise of a
<lb/>great and decisive victory.
<lb/>One night as he lay in bed, the wind car-
<lb/>ried to him the clangoring of the church-
<lb/>bell as some enthusiast jerked the rope frantically
<lb/>to tell the twisted news of a battle. The voice
<lb/>calling in the night had made him shiver in
<lb/>a prolonged ecstacy of excitement. Later

  <lb/>had spoken thus: "Ma, I'm goin' t' enlist."
  <lb/>"Henry, don't you be a fool," his mother

  <lb/>Nevertheless, the next morning he had gone

  <lb/>"The Lord's will be done, Henry," she had replied
  <lb/>and had continued to milk the brindle cow.
  <lb/>When he had stood in the door with his
  <lb/>soldier clothes on his back and a light of
  <lb/>excitement and expectation in his eyes, he had
  <lb/>seen two tears leave their burning trails on 
  <lb/>his mother's rough cheeks. Still she had
  <lb/>disappointed <del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_06_z014">by</del> him by saying nothing
  <lb/>about returning with his shield or on it.
  <lb/>To the contrary. She <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_06_z015">had</add> doggedly peeled potatoes

  <lb/>He had born this speech with impatience.
  <lb/>It was not quite what he <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#unattributed" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_08_z004">had</add><metamark place="inline" function="caret" rend="ink" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_08_z005">^</metamark> expected and it
  <lb/>had made him feel sheepish. He had felt
  <lb/>glad that no one of his friends had been
  <lb/>there to listen to it.
  <lb/>From his home, he had gone to the sem-
  <lb/>inary to bid adieu to many old schoolmates.
  <lb/>There, a certain light-haired girl <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_08_z003">ma</del> had made
  <lb/>vivacious efforts to poke fun at his martial spirit.
  <lb/>But there was another girl who, he <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_08_z002">had</del> thought,
  <lb/>had become <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_08_z001">ve</del> demure and sad at sight of

  <lb/>aisle between the rows of oaks on the lawn, he
  <lb/>had discovered her watching his departure
  <lb/>from a window. As he had turned and

  <lb/>river bank. They were a sun-tanned, philosophical
  <lb/>lot who sometimes shot thoughtfully at the oppos-
  <lb/>ite pickets but usually seemed sorry for it af-
  <lb/>terwards. Fleming on guard duty one night had
  <lb/>talked across the river w:ith one. He was a
  <lb/>slightly ragged man with a fund of sublime
  <lb/>assurance. Fleming liked him personally.
  <lb/>Various veterans had told him tales. Some
  <lb/>talked of grey, be-whiskered hordes who were
  <lb/>advancing, <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_10_z006">chewing tobacco</del> cursing relentlessly
  <lb/>and chewing tobacco with unspeakable valor;
  <lb/>tremendous bodies of fierce soldiery who were
  <lb/>sweeping along like the Huns. Others spoke
  <lb/>of tattered and eternally hungry men who fired
  <lb/>despondent rifles. From their stories, <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_10_z004">one</del> <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_10_z003">could</del> <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_10_z005">Fleming</add>

  <lb/>slits in the faded uniforms. Still, he could not
  <lb/>put <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_10_z001">faith</del> a whole faith in tales, for re-
  <lb/>cruits were the veteran's prey. They talked much
  <lb/>of smoke, fire and blood but he could not
  <lb/>tell how much might be lies.
  <lb/>However, he percieved that it did not greatly
  <lb/>matter what kind of soldiers he was going to
  <lb/>fight. There was a more serious problem. He
  <lb/>lay in his bunk debating the question. He
  <lb/>tried to solve it mathematically. He was en-
  <lb/>deavoring to decide wether he would run
  <lb/>from a fight or not.
  <lb/>It had suddenly come to his mind that
  <lb/>perhaps in a battle he might run. He was
</ab><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#rboc-d_11"/><ab rend="top"><metamark place="margin-top" function="foliation" rend="ink" change="dStA" facs="#rboc-d_11_z001">11</metamark></ab><ab><lb/>forced to admit that as far as war was con-

  <lb/>he had never been obliged to grapple too seriously
  <lb/>with the question. He had taken certain
  <lb/>things for granted, even as in thoughts about
  <lb/>his life, he had never <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_11_z005">had</add><metamark place="inline" function="caret" rend="ink" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_11_z006">^</metamark> doubts of the ultimate
  <lb/>success of it and had bothered little about
  <lb/>means and roads.
  <lb/>But he was now suddenly confronted. As
  <lb/>his imagination went forward to a fight, he
  <lb/>saw hideous possibilities. He contemplated the
  <lb/>lurking menaces of the future and failed in
  <lb/>an effort to see himself standing stoutly
  <lb/>in the midst of them. He recalled his <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_11_z007">sha</del>
  <lb/>visions of broken-bladed glory but in the sha-

  <lb/>He sprang from his bunk and began to
  <lb/>pace nervously up and down the floor. "Good
  <lb/>Gawd, what's the matter with me," he cried to
  <lb/>himself.
  <lb/>He felt that his laws of life were
  <lb/>useless. Whatever he had learned of him-
  <lb/>self was now of no consequence. He was
  <lb/><add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_11_z010">an</add> unknown quantity. He would again be ob-
  <lb/>liged to experiment, as he had in early youth,
  <lb/>and get upon his guard, else those qualities
  <lb/>of which he knew nothing might everlastingly
  <lb/>disgrace him. "Good Gawd," he repeated.

  <lb/>Fleming looked down at the busy figure. "Goin'

  <lb/>"There's been more or less fun made of 'em, 'cause they're
  <lb/>new, a' course, an' all that, but they'll fight good enough, I guess."
  <lb/>"Think any th' boys'ill run?" persisted Fleming.
  <lb/>"Oh, there maya few of 'em run but there's
  <lb/>them kind in ev'ry reg'ment, 'specially when they first
  <lb/>goes under fire," said Conklin in a tolerant way. "Of

  <lb/>each other names.

</ab><milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#rboc-d_15"/><ab><lb/>15<lb/>II.<lb/>Fleming was not at all relieved when he found that
  <lb/>Jim Conklin had been the fast-flying messenger of a
  <lb/>mistake. The tale had created in him a great con-
  <lb/>cern for himself. He now stood confronting the
  <lb/>possibilities. and with the new born question in his
  <lb/>mind, he was compelled to sink back into his old
  <lb/>place as part of a blue demonstration.
  <lb/>He kept up ceaseless calculations. They were
  <lb/>wondrously unsatisfactory. He could establish noth-
  <lb/>ing. He was anxious to prove beyond a doubt
  <lb/>that he would not be afraid. He wished to go
  <lb/>into the blaze and then figuratively to watch his
  <lb/>legs to discover their merits and faults. So he
  <lb/>fretted for an opportunity.
  <lb/>He was continually measuring himself by his
  <lb/>comrades. Conklin, for one, re-assured him. The for-
  <lb/>mer's serene unconcern gave him some confidence
  <lb/>because he had known him since childhood and
  <lb/>from his intimate knowledge, he did not see how
  <lb/>Conklin could be capable of anything that was
  <lb/>beyond him, Fleming. Still, he thought Conklin
  <lb/>might be mistaken about himself. Or, on the
  <lb/>other hand, he might be a man heretofore doomed
  <lb/>to obscurity in peace but in reality made for war.
  <lb/>He would have liked to have discovered an-
  <lb/>other man who suspected himself. A sympathetic
  <lb/>comparison of mental notes would have been a
  <lb/>great relief to him. He occasionally tried to fathom
</ab><milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#rboc-d_22"/><ab><lb/>22<lb/>sprightly, vigorous, and fiery in his desire for success. 
  <lb/>He looked into the future with clear proud eye.
  <lb/>"You're goin' t' do great things, I s'pose?" said
  <lb/>Fleming.
  <lb/>Wilson blew a dignified cloud of smoke in-
  <lb/>to the air. "Oh, I don't know," he remarked,
  <lb/>thoughtfully, "I don't know. I s'pose I'll do as
  <lb/>well as th' rest. I'm goin' t' try t', like thunder."
  <lb/>"How d'yeh know yeh won't run when th' time
  <lb/>comes," asked Fleming.
  <lb/>"'Run',?" said Wilson. "'Run'? Of course not."
  <lb/>"Well," continued Fleming, "lots of good 'nough
  <lb/>men have thought they was goin' t' do great things
  <lb/>'fore th' fight but when th' time come, they skedaddled."
  <lb/>"Oh, well, that's all true enough," said Wilson
  <lb/>with great assurance, "but I'm not goin' t' skedaddle.
  <lb/>Th' man that bets on my runnin' will lose his mon-
  <lb/>ey that's all." He wagged his head with much self-
  <lb/>confidence.
  <lb/>"Oh, shucks," said Fleming. "Yeh aint th'
  <lb/>bravest man in th' world, are yeh?"
  <lb/>"No, I aint," replied Wilson, savagely, "An' I
  <lb/>didn't say I was th' bravest man in th' world,
  <lb/>neither. I said I was going t' do my share
  <lb/>of fightin'--that's what I said. An' I am,
  <lb/>too." He glared angrily at Fleming too
  <lb/>for a moment and then arose and
  <lb/>strode away with an air of offended
  <lb/>pride.
</ab><milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#rboc-d_23"/><ab><lb/>23<lb/>Fleming felt alone in space when Wilson
  <lb/>the injured Wilson retired. His confidence in
  <lb/>the success of the army was as strong as 
  <lb/>any, but no one , but he, seemed to be wrestling 
  <lb/>with such a terrific personal problem. The valiant 
  <lb/>Wilson made him more miserable than before.
  <lb/>He went to his tent and stretched out on 
  <lb/>a blanket. He could hear serene voices. "'I'll 
  <lb/>bid five." "Make it six." "Seven!" "Seven goes."
  <lb/>He saw visions of a thousand-tongued fear 
  <lb/>that would babble at his back and cause him to 
  <lb/>flee while others were going coolly about their 
  <lb/>country's business. He stared at the red, shivering re-
  <lb/>flection of a fire on the white wall of his tent 
  <lb/>until, exhausted and ill from viewing the pic-
  <lb/>tures that thronged upon his mental vision,. He 
  <lb/>he fell asleep.
</ab><milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#rboc-d_28"/><ab><lb/>28<lb/>stupids. The enemy would presently encompass them and
  <lb/>swallow the whole cammand. He glared about him as if hunted.
  <lb/>He thought that he must break from the ranks and
  <lb/>harangue his comrades. They must not all be killed like pigs.
  <lb/>And he was sure it would be so. And he was sure it would
  <lb/>be so. The general were idiots to send them marching
  <lb/>into a regular pen. He would step forth and make
  <lb/>a speech. Shrill and passionate words were at his lips.
  <lb/>The line broken into moving fragments by the
  <lb/>ground went calmly on through fields and woods.
  <lb/>Fleming looked at the men nearest him and saw
  <lb/>for the most part, expressions of deep interest as if they
  <lb/>were investigating something that had fascinated them.
  <lb/>Some stepped with an over-valiant air as if they were
  <lb/>already plunged into war. Others went as upon thin
  <lb/>ice. The greater part of the untested men seemed appeared
  <lb/>quiet and absorbed.
  <lb/>As he looked, Fleming gripped his out-cry at
  <lb/>his throat. He saw that even if they were tottering
  <lb/>with fear they would laugh at his oration. They
  <lb/>would jeer him and, if practicable, pelt him with
  <lb/>missiles. Admitting that he might be wrong, a
  <lb/>frenzied declamation of the kind would turn him
  <lb/>into a worm.
  <lb/>He assumed the demeanor of one who is doomed, a-
  <lb/>knows that he is doomed, alone, to unwritten responsibilities.
  <lb/>Presently, the brigade was halted in the cathedral-
  <lb/>light of a forest. The busy skirmishers were still
  <lb/>popping. Through the aisles of the wood could be
  <lb/>seen the floating smoke from their rifles.
</ab><milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#rboc-d_29"/><ab><lb/>29.<lb/>Each front-rank man in the regiment began erecting a
  <lb/>tiny hill in front of him. They used stones, earth and any-
  <lb/>thing they thought would turn a bullet. Some built
  <lb/>comparatively large ones while others seemed content with
  <lb/>little ones. In a short time, there was quite a barricade
  <lb/>along the regimental front. Directly, however, they re-
  <lb/>cieved orders to withdraw from that place.
  <lb/>This astounded Fleming. He forgot his stewing over
  <lb/>the advance movement. "Well, then, what did they march
  <lb/>us out here fer?" he demanded of Jim Conklin. The
  <lb/>latter with calm faith began a ponderous explan-
  <lb/>ation. Fleming scoffed at him.
  <lb/>When the brigade was aligned in another position,
  <lb/>each man's care for his safety caused another barricade
  <lb/>to be erected created. They were moved from this one
  <lb/>also. They ate their none noon meal behind a third one. They
  <lb/>were marched about from place to place with apparent
  <lb/>aimlessness.
  <lb/>Fleming grew feverishly impatient. He considered
  <lb/>that there was denoted a lack of purpose on the part of
  <lb/>the generals. He began to complain to Jim Conklin. "I
  <lb/>can't stand this much longer," he cried. "I don't see
  <lb/>what good it does to make us jest wear out'r legs fer
  <lb/>nothin'."
  <lb/>The philosophical Conklin measured a sandwhich
  <lb/>of cracker and pork and engulfed in a nonchalant man-
  <lb/>ner. "Oh, I s'pose we must go reconnoiterin' aroun' th'
  <lb/>kentry jest t' keep 'em from gittin' too clost, or, t' dev-
  <lb/>elope 'em, or somethin'."
  <lb/>"Huh," said Wilson.

  <lb/>A shell screaming like a storm-banshee went
  <lb/>over the heads of huddled heads of the reserves. It
  <lb/>landed in the grove and, exploding redly, flung the
  <lb/>brown earth. There was a little shower of pine-
  <lb/>needles.
  <lb/>Bullets began to nip at the trees. The men of
  <lb/>the reserved brigade crouched behind their various pro-
  <lb/>tections and peered toward the front. Some kept contin-<lb/>ually dodging and ducking their heads as if assailed by snow-balls.
  <lb/>An officiers officer of Fleming's regiment was shot
  <lb/>in the hand. He began to swear so wondrously that
  <lb/>a nervous laugh went along the rebel line regimental
  <lb/>line. The officer's profanity sounded conventional. It
  <lb/>relieved the tightened senses of the new men. It was as
  <lb/>if he had hit his fingers with a tack-hammer at home.

  <lb/>side so that the blood would not drip upon his clothes.
  <lb/>trousers.--, while another bound it awkwardly with a handkerchief.
  <lb/>The battle-flag in the distance jerked about wrath-
  <lb/>fully. It seemed to be in an struggling to free itself
  <lb/>from an agony. The billowing smoke was filled with horiz-
  <lb/>ontal flashes.
  <lb/>Men, running swiftly, emerged from it. They grew
  <lb/>in numbers until it was seen that the whole cammand 
  <lb/>as fleeing. The flag suddenly sank down as if
  <lb/>dying. It's motion was like a gesture of despair.
  <lb/>Wild yells came from behind the veil of smoke. A
  <lb/>sketch in grey and red dissolved into a mob-like
  <lb/>body of men who galloped like wild-horses.
  <lb/>The veteran regiments on the right and left
  <lb/>of the 304th began to jeer. With the passionate song of the
</ab><milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#rboc-d_39"/><ab><lb/>39<lb/>V<lb/><del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_39_z019">105</del> There were moments of waiting. Fleming thought of
  <lb/>the village street at home before the arrival of the cir-
  <lb/>cus parade. He remembered how he <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_39_z013">had</add> stood a small
  <lb/>thrillful boy<del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_39_z018">.</del>, prepared to follow the band or the
  <lb/>dingy lady upon the white <restore change="dstX" hand="#SC" facs="#rboc-d_39_z014">s.h</restore>orse. He saw the
  <lb/>yellow road, the lines of expectant people, and
  <lb/>the sober houses. He remembered an old fellow
  <lb/>who used to sit upon a cracker-box in front of
  <lb/>the store and fiegn to despise such exhibitions.
  <lb/>Some one cried: "Hear they come."
  <lb/>There was a rustling and muttering among
  <lb/>the men. They displayed a feverish desire to have
  <lb/><del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_39_z006">everything</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_39_z006">all their munitions</add> ready to their hands. Cartridge-boxes

  <lb/>locks clicked.
  <lb/>Jim Conklin, having prepared himself, produced
  <lb/>a red handkerchief. He was engaged in knotting
  <lb/>it accurately about his throat when the cry was
  <lb/>repeated up and down the line: "Here they come!
  <lb/>Here they come!"
  <lb/>Across the smoke-infested fields came a brown
  <lb/>bunch of running men who were giving shrill yells.
  <lb/>They came on stooping and swinging their rifles
  <lb/>at all angles. A flag, tilted forward, sped
  <lb/>near the front.
  <lb/>As he caught sight of them, Fleming was
  <lb/>suddenly smitten with the <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_39-0001">chanc</del> thought
  <lb/>that perhaps his rifle <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_39_z009">wasn</del> was not loaded.

  <lb/>In his agitation, the colonel began to stam-
  <lb/>mer. "A-all right, general, we-we'll d-do our b-best(.")
  <lb/>The general made a passionate gesture and gal-
  <lb/>loped away. The colonel, perchance as a woman
  <lb/>releaves her feelings with tears, began to swear
  <lb/>sweepingly. Fleming, turning swiftly to make sure
  <lb/>that the rear was unmolested, saw the cursing
  <lb/>cammander regarding his regiment in a very
  <lb/>resentful manner.
  <lb/>The man at Fleming's elbow was mumbling
  <lb/>as if to himself: "Oh, we're in for it now. We're
  <lb/>in for it now."
  <lb/>The captain of the campany had been pac-
  <lb/>ing eXcitedly to and fro in the rear and had har-
  <lb/>angued like a school-mistress: "Reserve your fire,
  <lb/>boys--don't shoot 'til I tell you--save your fire

  <lb/>He frequently with a nervous movement wiped his eyes
  <lb/>with his coat sleeve.
  <lb/>He got a swift glance at the foe-swarming
  <lb/>field in front of him and, instantly, before he was
  <lb/>quite ready to begin, before he had announced
  <lb/>to himself that he was about to fight, he threw
  <lb/>the obedient, well-balanced rifle into position
  <lb/>and fired a first, wild shot. Directly, he
</ab><milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#rboc-d_42"/><ab><lb/>42.<lb/>Following this came a red rage. He developed the
  <lb/>acute exasperation of a pestered <del rend="doublestrikethrough pencil" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_42_z001">cow</del> animal, a well-
  <lb/>meaning animal cow worried by dogs. He had a furious feeling
  <lb/>against his weapon that could only kill one man at a
  <lb/>time. He wished to rush forward and strangle with
  <lb/>his hands. He craved a power that would enable
  <lb/>him to make a mad, world-sweeping gesture and
  <lb/>brush all back. His impotency appeared to him
  <lb/>and made his rage into that of a driven beast.

  <lb/>There was a blare of heated <del rend="strikethrough pencil" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_42_z006">anger</del>, rage,
  <lb/>mingled with a certain expression of intentness,
  <lb/>on all faces. Nearly every man was making a
  <lb/>noise with his mouth. The cheers, snarls, im-
  <lb/>precations, wailings, made a wild, barbaric song.
  <lb/>The man at Fleming's elbow was babbling like an
  <lb/>infant. Jim Conklin was swearing in a loud voice.
  <lb/>From his lips came a black procession of curious
  <lb/>oaths. Suddenly, another broke out in a querelous
  <lb/>way like a man who has mislaid his hat: "Well,

  <lb/>drearily toward the rear. It was like a flow of
  <lb/>blood from the torn body of the regiment.
  <lb/>To the right and left were the dark lines of other
  <lb/>troops. Far in front, he could see lighter masses protrud-
  <lb/>ing in points from the one woods. They were vaguely suggestive
  <lb/>of untold thousands.
  <lb/>Once he saw a tiny battery go dashing along the line
  <lb/>of the horizon. The tiny riders were beating the tiny horses.
  <lb/>From a sloping hill came the sound of cheering and
  <lb/>clashes. Smokes welled steadily up. Batteries were speaking
  <lb/>with thunderous oratorical effort. Here and there, were flags,
  <lb/>the red in the stripes dominating. They splashed bits of
  <lb/>brilliant color upon the dark troops.
  <lb/>Fleming felt the old thrill at the sight of the emblems.
  <lb/>They were like beautiful birds strangely undaunted in a storm.
  <lb/>As he listened to the din from the hill-side hill side, and
  <lb/>to a deep pulsating thunder that came from afar to the
  <lb/>right and to the lesser clamors which came from
  <lb/>many directions, it occurred to Fleming that they were
  <lb/>fighting too, over there and over there and over there.
  <lb/>Heretofore he had supposed that the battle was directly
  <lb/>under his nose.
  <lb/>As he gazed around him, Fleming felt a flash of as-
  <lb/>tonishment at the blue, pure sky and the sun-gleam-
  <lb/>ings on the trees and fields. It was surprising
  <lb/>that nature had gone tranquilly with her
  <lb/>golden processes in the midst of so much devil-
  <lb/>ment.

  <lb/>So it was all over. He went into an ecstasy of self-satis-

  <lb/>percieved that the man who had fought thus was magnificent.

  <lb/>with men whose features only were familar but with 
  <lb/>whom Fleming now felt the bonds of tied hearts. He 
  <lb/>helped a cursing comrade to bind up a wound 
  <lb/>of the shin.

  <lb/>ranks of the new regiment. "Here they come ag'in! Here

  <lb/>Fleming turned quick eyes on the field. He saw 
  <lb/>forms begin to swell in masses out of a distant <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dStX" facs="#rboc-d_47_z001">wood</add>. He

  <lb/>Too, shells exploded in the grass and among the

  <lb/>into fierce bloom.
  <lb/>The men groaned. The slaves toiling in the tem-

  <lb/>expressed a profound dejection. They moved their stiff-
  <lb/>ened bodies slowly and watched in sullen mood the 
  <lb/>frantic approach of the enemy.
  <lb/>Some began to fret and complain. "Oh, say, this 
  <lb/>is too much of a good thing. Why can't som<add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_47_z012">e</add>body send <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_47_z010">us</add> supports?"

  <lb/>Fleming's eyes had a look in them that one can

  <lb/>arms <subst facs="#rboc-d_48_z005"><del rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_48_z005">left</del><add place="above" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_48_z005">felt</add></subst> numb and bloodless. His hands, too, seemed 
  <lb/>large and awkward as if he were wearing invisible 
  <lb/>mittens. And there was a great uncertainty about his knee-joints.
  <lb/>The words that comrades had uttered previous to 
  <lb/>the firing began to appear to him. "Oh, say, this is too 
  <lb/>much of a good thing." "What do they take us fer--why 
  <lb/>don't they send us supports." "I didn't come here t' fight 
  <lb/>th' hull damn rebel army."
  <lb/>He began to exaggerate the endurance, the skill 
  <lb/>and the valor of those who were coming. They must be
  <lb/>steel machines. Himself, reeling from nervous exhaustion, 
  <lb/>he could not understand such persistency.
  <lb/>He mechanically lifted his rifle and, catching 
  <lb/>a glimpse of <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_48_z009">a cantering cluster</del> the thick-spread field,
  <lb/>he fired a shot at a cantering<del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_48_z008">ly</del> cluster. He stopped 
  <lb/>then and began to gaze as best he could through the 
  <lb/>smoke. He caught changing views of the ground 
  <lb/>covered with men who were all running and yell-
  <lb/>ing like pursued imps.
  <lb/>To him, it was an onslaught of dragons. He be

  <lb/>in a sort of a horrified, listening attitude. He

  <lb/>howls. A lad whose face had born an expression of exalted cour

  <lb/>at midnight and is suddenly made aware. There was a revel

  <lb/>Others began to scamper away through the smoke.
  <lb/>Fleming turned his head, shaken from his trance by this
  <lb/>movement as if the regiment was leaving him behind. He
  <lb/>saw the few fleeting forms.
  <lb/>He yelled then with fright and swung about. For
  <lb/>a moment, in the clamor, he was like a proverbial
  <lb/>chicken. He lost the direction of safety. Destruction
  <lb/>threatened him from all points.
  <lb/>Directly he began to speed toward the rear
  <lb/>in great leaps. His rifle and cap were gone. <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_49_z010">His un</del>

  <lb/>He ran like a blind man. Two or three
  <lb/>times, he fell down and once he knocked his

  <lb/>long. He felt that death was ever about to thrust
  <lb/>him between the shoulder blades.
  <lb/>He ran on mingling with others. He <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_49_z018">saw men</del> 
  <lb/>vaguely saw men on his right and on his left, and he

  <lb/>Shells were hurtling over his head. He imagined

  <lb/>toward <add place="above" rend="caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_50_z004">him</add> as they passed.
  <lb/>He experienced a thrill of amazement as he
  <lb/>passed the battery in the field back of the grove. The
  <lb/>artillerymen were going swiftly about their tasks. They
  <lb/>were continually bending in coaxing postures over the guns.
  <lb/>They seemed to be patting them on the back and en-
  <lb/>couraging them with words. The guns stolid and un-
  <lb/>daunted, spoke with dogged valor.
  <lb/>The precise gunners were cool save for their
  <lb/>eyes which were lifted every chance toward <restore change="dstX" hand="#SC" facs="#rboc-d_50_z009">a</restore>
  <lb/>smoked-wreathed hillock from whence a hostile bat-

  <lb/>Methodical idiots! Machine-like fools! Staying to
  <lb/>be eaten up! The face of a youthful rider who was
  <lb/>jerking his frantic horse with the abandon of tem-
  <lb/>per he might display in a placid barn-yard was
  <lb/>impressed deep upon his mind. He knew he looked
  <lb/><del rend="overwrite pencil" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_50_z010">upon</del> a man who would presently be dead.
  <lb/>He saw a brigade going to the relief of it's

  <lb/>watched it, sweeping finely, keeping formation in
  <lb/>difficult places. The blue of the line was crusted
  <lb/>with steel-color and brilliant flags projected.
  <lb/>Officers were shouting.
</ab><milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#rboc-d_51"/><ab>  <lb/>51  <lb/>This Sight, also, filled him with wonder. The brigade 
  <lb/>was hurrying briskly to be gulped into the infernal

  <lb/>The guns with their noses poked slantingly at the 
  <lb/>ground, grumbled and grunted like stout men un
  <lb/>duly hurried.
  <lb/>Fleming ran on.
  <lb/>Later he came upon a general of division seated 
  <lb/>upon a horse that pricked it's ears in an interested way 
  <lb/>at the battle. There was <del rend="strikethrough pencil" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_51_z007">much</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_51_z008">a great</add> gleaming of yellow and 
  <lb/>patent-leather about the saddle and bridle. The quiet 
  <lb/>man astride looked mouse-colored upon such a 
  <lb/>splendid charger.
  <lb/>A jingling staff was galloping hither and thither. 
  <lb/>Sometimes, the general was surrounded by horsem<subst facs="#rboc-d_51_z010"><del rend="pencil" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_51_z010">a</del><add place="inline" rend="pencil" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_51_z010">e</add></subst>n and at 
  <lb/>other times he was quite alone. He looked much har

  <lb/>market is swinging up and down.
  <lb/>Fleming went slinking around the spot. He went 
  <lb/>as near as he dared, trying to over-hear words. Per
  <lb/>haps, too, the general, un�able to comprehend chaos, 
  <lb/>might call upon him for information. And he

<lb/>As he went<del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_52_z043">nea</del> warily nearer, he heard the

  <lb/>He thought of his comrades. They had staid and

  <lb/>ity of those little pieces had betrayed him. He had 
  <lb/>been over-turned and crushed by their lack of sense 
  <lb/>in holding a position that a little thought would 
  <lb/>have convinced them to be impossible. He, the

  <lb/>He dreaded lest these voices and noisy
  <lb/>motions would bring men to look at him.
  <lb/>He went far, seeking dark and intricate places.
  <lb/>The musketry grew faint and the cannon boomed in the distance.
  <lb/>The sun, suddenly apparent, blazed among the
  <lb/>trees. The in�sects were making rythmical noises. They
  <lb/>seemed to be grinding their teeth in unison. A woodpecker
  <lb/>stuck his insolent head around the side of a tree. A
  <lb/>bird flew on light-hearted wing.
  <lb/>Off was the rumble of death. It seemed now that
  <lb/>nature had no ears.
  <lb/>This landscape gave him assurance. It was the
  <lb/>religion of peace. It would die if it's timid eyes were
  <lb/>compelled to see blood. He concieved nature to be a
  <lb/>woman with a deep aversion to tragedy.
  <lb/>He threw a pine-cone at a jovial and pot-
  <lb/>valiant squirrel and it ran with chattering fear.
  <lb/>There was the law, he thought. Nature had given him
  <lb/>a sign.
  <lb/>He wended feeling that nature agreed with him.
  <lb/>It reinforced his arguments with proofs
  <lb/>that lived where the sun shone.
  <lb/>He found himself almost into a swamp once.
  <lb/>He was obliged to walk on bog-tufts and watch
  <lb/>his feet to keep from the oily mire. Pausing
  <lb/>once to look about him, he saw, out on some black
  <lb/>water, a small animal pounce in and
  <lb/>emerge directly with a silver-gleaming fish. Pres-
  <lb/>ently, he was again in the deep thickets. The
  <lb/>brushed branches made a noise that drowned

  <lb/>the sounds of cannon.
  <lb/>He went on, going from obscurity to promises
  <lb/>of a greater obscurity.
  <lb/>At length, he reached a place where the high,
  <lb/>arching boughs made a chapel. SHe softly pushed the
  <lb/>green doors aside and entered. Pine-needles were a gentle
  <lb/>brown carpet. There was a religious half-light.
  <lb/>Near the threshold, he stopped horror-stricken
  <lb/>at the sight of a thing.
  <lb/>He was being looked at by a dead man who was
  <lb/>seated with his back against a treecolumn-like tree.
  <lb/>The corpse was dressed in a uniform that once had
  <lb/>been blue but itwas now faded to a melancholy green.
  <lb/>The eyes, staring at Fleming, had changed to the
  <lb/>dull hue to be seen on the side of a dead fish.
  <lb/>The mouth was opened. It's red had changed to an
  <lb/>apalling yellow. Over the grey skin of the face ran
  <lb/>little ants. One was trundling some sort of a bundle
  <lb/>along the upper lip.
  <lb/>Fleming gave a shriek as he confronted the thing.
  <lb/>He was for an instant turned to stone before it. He
  <lb/>remained staring into the dulled,liquid-looking eyes.
  <lb/>Then, he cautiously put one hand behind him and
  <lb/>touched a tree. Leaning upon this he retreated step
  <lb/>by step with his face still toward the thing. He feared
  <lb/>that if he turned his back, the thing might spring
  <lb/>up and stealthily pursue him.
  <lb/>The branches, pushing against him, threatened
  <lb/>to pushthrow him over upon it. His unguided feet, too,
  <lb/>caught aggravatingly in brambles. And, hewithal, he recieved
  <lb/>a subtle suggestion to touch the corpse. As he

  <lb/>bur�nished sun sank until slanted bronze rays struck 
  <lb/>the tree-tops. There was a lull in the noise of insects 
  <lb/>as if they had bowed their beaks and were making a 
  <lb/>devotional pause. There was silence save for the chanted
  <lb/>chorus of the trees.
  <lb/>Upon this stillness there suddenly broke a tre-
  <lb/>mendous clangor of sounds. A crimson roar came from the distance.
  <lb/>Fleming paused. He was transfixed by this terrific medley
  <lb/>of all noises. It was as if worlds were being rended. The
  <lb/>ripping of musketry was mingled with the breaking 
  <lb/>crash of the <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_59_z001"><metamark place="inline" function="foliation" rend="ink" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_59_z001">artillery</metamark></del> cannon.
  <lb/>His mind flew in all directions. He concieved
  <lb/>the two armies to be at each other panther-wise. He 
  <lb/>listened for a time. Then he began to run in the dir-
  <lb/>ection of the battle. He saw that it was an ironical 
  <lb/>thing for him to be running thus toward that which 
  <lb/>he had been at such pains to avoid. But he said, 
  <lb/><del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_59_z002"><metamark place="inline" function="foliation" rend="ink" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_59_z002">to himself</metamark>,</del> in sub�stance, to himself that if the earth 
  <lb/>and moon were about to clash together, many would
  <lb/>plan to get upon roofs to witness the collision.
  <lb/>As he ran, he was aware that the forest had 
  <lb/>stopped it's music as if at last becoming capable of
  <lb/>hearing the foriegn sounds. The trees hushed and 
  <lb/>bended forward. Everything seemed to be listening 
  <lb/>to the crackle and <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_59_z003"><metamark place="inline" function="foliation" rend="ink" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_59_z003">clamo</metamark></del> clatter of the infantry fir-

  <lb/>The chorus pealed over the still earth.

  <lb/>of view of he and his fellows during that encounter. They
  <lb/>had taken themselves and the enemy very seriously and
  <lb/>had imagined that they were deciding the war. Individuals
  <lb/>might have supposed that they were cutting the letters
  <lb/>of their names deep into everlasting tablets of brass
  <lb/>or enshrining their reputations forever in the hearts of
  <lb/>their countrymen, while, as to fact, the affair would

  <lb/>But he saw that it was good, else, he said, in battle ev-
  <lb/>eryone would doubtless run save for lorn hope and their ilk.
  <lb/>He went rapidly <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_60_z007">on</del>on. He wanted <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_60_z008">to</add> come to the
  <lb/>edge of the forest and peer out.
  <lb/>As he hurried, there passed through his mind
  <lb/>pictures of stupendous struggles. All his accumulations
  <lb/>upon such subjects were used to form scenes. The up-
  <lb/>roar was as <subst facs="#rboc-d_60_z017"><del rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_60_z017">a</del><add place="inline" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_60_z017">t</add></subst>he voice of an eloquent being describing.
  <lb/>Sometimes, the brambles formed chains and held

  <lb/>But he took roundabout ways. Presently he was
  <lb/>in a place from which he could see long fringes
  <lb/>of smoke where battle-lines lay. The voices of
  <lb/>the cannon shook him. He stood for a moment
  <lb/>and watched. His <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_60_z011">I</del>eyes had an awe-struck ex-

  <lb/>61A
  <lb/>Presently, he continued his way. The battle was like the grinding of an immense and terrible machine to him. It's complexities and powers, it's grim processes fascinated him. He must go close and see it produce corpses.
  <lb/>He came to some deserted rifle-pits and clambered over them. Within, the trench was littered with clothes and guns. A newspaper folded up lay in the dirt. A dead soldier was stretched with his face hidden in his arm, and further on there was a group of four or five bodies keeping mournful company. A hot sun had blazed upon the spot.
  <lb/>As he looked, Fleming felt like an invader and he hastened by. He came finally to a road from which he could see, in the distance, dark and agitated bodies of troops. In the lane, was a blood-stained crowd streaming to the rear. The wounded men were cursing, lamenting and groaning. In the air always, was a mighty swell of sound that it seemed could sway the earth. With the courageous words of the artillery and the spiteful sentences of the musketry was mingled red cheers. And from this place of noises came the steady current of the maimed.
  <lb/>One wounded man had a shoeful of blood. He was hopping like a school-boy in a game. He laughed hysterically.
  <lb/>One was marching with an air imitative of some sublime drum-major. Upon his features was an unholy mixture
</ab><milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#rboc-d_61B"/>

  <lb/>61B
  <lb/>of merriment and agony. As he marched, he sang a bit of doggerel in a high and quavering voice.
  <lb/>"Sing a song of vict'ry"
  <lb/>"A pocketful a' bullets"
  <lb/>"Five an' twenty dead men"
  <lb/>"Baked in a-pie."
  <lb/>Parts of the procession limped and staggered to this tune.
  <lb/>Another had the grey seal of death already upon his face. His lips were curled in hard lines and his teeth were clenched. His hands were bloody from where he had pressed them upon his wound. He seemed to be awaiting the moment when he should pitch headlong. He stalked like the spectre of a soldier, his eyes burning with the power of a stare into the unknown.
  <lb/>There were some who proceeded sullenly, full of anger at their wounds and ready to turn upon anything as an obscure cause.
  <lb/>An officer was carried along by two privates. He was peevish. "Don't joggle so, Johnson, yeh fool," he cried. "Think m' leg is made of iron? If yeh can't carry me decent, leave me down an' let some one else do it."
  <lb/>He bellowed at the tottering crowd who blocked the quick march of his bearers. "Say, make way there, cant yeh? Make way, dickens take it all."
  <lb/>They sulkily parted and went to the roadsides. As he was carried past, they made pert remarks to him. When he raged in reply and threatened them, they told him to be damned.
  <lb/>The shoulder of one of the tramping bearers knocked heavily against the spectral soldier who was staring into the unknown.

  <lb/>Fleming was startled by this question although at

  <lb/>"What?" he asked. 
  <lb/>"Where yeh hit?" repeated the tattered man.
  <lb/>"Why," began Fleming, "I--I--that is--why--"
  <lb/>He turned away suddenly and slid through the 
  <lb/>crowd.
  <lb/>The tattered man looked after him in astonishment.

  <lb/>Conklin made a little common-place smile. "Hello, Flem,"

  <lb/>"Yeh know," said Conklin, "I was out there." He made
  <lb/>a careful gesture. "An', Lord, what a circus. An',

  <lb/>Fleming put forth anxious arms to assist his friend
  <lb/>but the latter went firmly on as if propelled.
  <lb/>Suddenly, as they went, Conklin seemed to be
  <lb/>overcome by a terror. His face turned to a sem-
  <lb/>blance of grey paste. He clutched Flemings arm
  <lb/>and began to talk to him in a shaking voice.

  <lb/>Looking about swiftly, Fleming saw his friend run-

  <lb/>There was a grotesque race.

  <lb/>"Leave me be! Leave me be!"
  <lb/>Suddenly, his form stiffened and straightened. 
  <lb/>Then it was shaken by a prolonged ague. He 
  <lb/>stared into space. It was seen that there was a 
  <lb/>curious and profound dignity in the firm

  <lb/>The body seemed to bounce a little way from
  <lb/>the earth. "Gawd," said the tattered soldier.
  <lb/>Fleming had watched, spell-bound, these
  <lb/>rites of a departing life, this dance of death.
  <lb/>His face had been twisted into every form of agony
  <lb/>that he had imagined for his friend.
  <lb/>He now sprang to his <subst facs="#rboc-d_70_z014"><del rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_70_z014">a</del><add place="inline" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_70_z014">feet</add></subst> and gazed at

  <lb/>the teeth showed in a laugh.
  <lb/>As the flap of the blue jacket fell away
  <lb/>from the body, he could see that the side
  <lb/>looked as if it had been chewed by wolves.
  <lb/>Fleming turned toward the battle ground. His
  <lb/>hands were clenched<del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_70_z011">.</del> and a rage was upon his

  <lb/>"Well, he was a reg'lar jim-dandy fer nerve, w'a'nt 
  <lb/>he?" he said he finally in a little, awe-struck voice. 
  <lb/>"A reg'lar jim-dandy, he was."
  <lb/>He thoughtfully pushed one of the dead hands with his 
  <lb/>toe. "I wonder where he got 'is stren'th from. I never 
  <lb/>seen a man do like that before. It was a curious thing. 
  <lb/>Well, he was a reg'lar jim-dandy."
  <lb/>Fleming desired to screech out his grief. He was 
  <lb/>stabbed. But his tongue lay dead in the tomb of 
  <lb/>his mouth. He threw himself upon the ground and 
  <lb/>began to brood.
  <lb/>The tattered man stood musing.
  <lb/>"Look-a-here, pardner," he said after a time. 
  <lb/>He regarded the corpse as he spoke. "He's up an' gone, 
  <lb/>aint, 'e, an' we might as well begin t' look out fer

  <lb/>'im. An' I must say I aint enjoyin' any great health
  <lb/>m'self these days."
  <lb/>Fleming, awakened by the tattered soldier's tone, 
  <lb/>looked quickly up. He saw that he saw swinging 
  <lb/>uncertainly on his legs and that his face had 
  <lb/>turned a blue shade.
  <lb/>"Good Lord," he cried. "You aint goin' t'--not 
  <lb/>you, too?"
  <lb/>The tattered soldier waved his hand. "Nary die," 
  <lb/>he said. "All I want is some pea-soup an' a

  <lb/>came from. I left him over there." He pointed. 
  <lb/>"An' now I find 'urn here. An' he was a comin' from

  <lb/>"They both turned toward the body as if to 
  <lb/>ask a question of it.
  <lb/>"Well," at length said the tattered man, wearily, 
  <lb/>"there haint no use in our stayin' here an' astin' im ayanything."
  <lb/>They gazed at the corpse for a moment.
  <lb/>Fleming murmured something.
  <lb/>"He was a jim-dandy, w'a'nt he," said the 
  <lb/>tattered man as if in response.
  <lb/>They turned their backs upon it and started 
  <lb/>away. It was still laughing there in the grass.
  <lb/>'I'm commencin' t' feel pretty bad," said the 
  <lb/>tattered man suddenly breaking one of his small silences.
  <lb/>Fleming groaned. "Oh, Lord!"
  <lb/>The other waved his hand again. "IOh, I'm not

  <lb/>Fleming glancing at his companion could see 
  <lb/>by the shadow of a smile that he was making fun.
  <lb/>As they plodded on, the tattered man continued 
  <lb/>to talk. "Besides, if I died I wouldn't die th'

  <lb/>And he was bitter that among all men,

  <lb/>understand these things.
</ab><milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#rboc-d_77"/><ab><lb/>77<lb/>XI<lb/>He became aware that the furnace-roar of the battle was 
  <lb/>growing louder. Great brown clouds had floated to the still 
  <lb/>heights of air before him. The noise, too, was approaching. 
  <lb/>The woods filtered men and the fields became dotted.
  <lb/>As he rounded a hillock, he percieved that the road-
  <lb/>way was now a crying mass of wagons, teams and men. From 
  <lb/>the heaving tangle issued exhortations, cammands and im-
  <lb/>precations. Fear was sweeping it all along. The biting
  <lb/>cracking whips bit, and horses plunged and tugged. The 
  <lb/>white-topped wagons strained and stumbled in their exertions 
  <lb/>like fat sheep.
  <lb/>Fleming felt in a measure comforted by the sight. 
  <lb/>They were all retreating. Perhaps, then, he was not so bad 
  <lb/>after all. He seated himself and watched the fleeing wag-
  <lb/>ons. All the roarers and lashers served to help him to 
  <lb/>magnify the dangers and horrors of anthe engagement 
  <lb/>that he might try to prove to himself that the thing 
  <lb/>with which men mightcould charge him, was, in truth, 
  <lb/>a symetrical act.
  <lb/>Presently, the calm head of a column of infantry ap-
  <lb/>peared in the road. It came swiftly on. Avoiding 
  <lb/>the obstructions gave it the sinuous movement of a 
  <lb/>long serpent. The men at the head butted mules with 
  <lb/>their musket-stocks. They prodded teamsters, indifferent 
  <lb/>to all howls. The men forced their way through parts 
  <lb/>of the dense mass by strength. The blunt head of the 
  <lb/>column pushed. The wild teamsters swore many strange 
  <lb/>oaths.
  <lb/>The cammands to make way had the ring of a 
  <lb/>great importance in them. The men were going for-
  <lb/>ward. They were to confront the eager rush of the

  <lb/>the whole army seemed trying to dribble down this road. 
  <lb/>They tumbled teams about with a fine feeling that it was 
  <lb/>no matter so long as their column got to the front in time. 
  <lb/>This importance made their <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_78_z001">column</del><add place="inline" rend="no-caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_78_z014">faces</add> stern and quiet, 
  <lb/>and the backs of the officers were very rigid.
  <lb/>As he looked at them, Fleming knew all of his
  <lb/>woe. He felt that he was regarding a procession of 
  <lb/>chosen beings. The separation was as great to him as 
  <lb/>if they had marched with weapons of flame and 
  <lb/>banners of sunlight. He could never be like them. 
  <lb/>He could have wept in his longings.
  <lb/>He searched about in his mind then for a 
  <lb/>proper malediction for the indefinite cause, that 
  <lb/>thing <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_78_z017">to</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_78_z016">upon</add> which men turn the words of final blame. 
  <lb/>It was responsible for him. There lay the fault.
  <lb/>The haste of the column to reach the battle-ground 
  <lb/>struck forlorn Fleming as being something <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_78_z008">more</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_78_z007">much finer</add> than stout

  <lb/>in his stomach and when he moved, his head sway-

  <lb/>Small patches of crimson mist floated before his vision.
  <lb/>While he had been tossed by many emotions, he 
  <lb/>had not been aware of ailments. Now they beset him and 
  <lb/>made clamor. As he was at last compelled to pay

  <lb/>multiplied. He groaned from his heart and staggered

  <lb/>In a defeat there would be a roundabout 
  <lb/>moral vindication of himself. He thought that it 
  <lb/>would prove, in a way, that he had fled early be-
  <lb/>cause of his superior powers of perception. This he re-
  <lb/>garded as a very important thing. Without salve, 
  <lb/>he could not, he said, wear the sore badge of his 
  <lb/>dishonor through life. With his heart continually as-
  <lb/>suring him that he was despicable, he could not 
  <lb/>exist without making it apparent to all men, im-
  <lb/>parting the information through his actions.
  <lb/>But if the army had gone gloriously on, he 
  <lb/>would be indeed lost. If the din meant that now 
  <lb/>his army's flags were tilted forward he was a

  <lb/>self to isolation. If the men were advancing, their indif-

  <lb/>As these thoughts went rapidly through his mind, he sud-
  <lb/>denly turned upon them and tried to savagely thrust 
  <lb/>them away. With woe upon his face, he denounced him-
  <lb/>self as a villian. He was he said the most unutterably 
  <lb/>selfish man in existence. His mind pictured the men who 
  <lb/>would place their defiant bodies before the spear of the 
  <lb/>yelling battle-fiend and as he saw their wetltering corpses 
  <lb/>on an imagined field, he said that he was their murderer.

  <lb/>They might have been killed by lucky chances, he 
  <lb/>said, before they had had opportunities to flee or 
  <lb/>before they had been really tested. Yet they would 
  <lb/>recieve laurels from traditions. He cried out bitterly

  <lb/>was a pity that he was not as they.
  <lb/>A defeat of the army had suggested itself to him 
  <lb/>as a means of escape from the consequences of his 
  <lb/>fall. He considered howerer that it was <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dstX" facs="#rboc-d_82_z009">very</del>use-

  <lb/>He had then a feeling that he was the growing prophet of a world-reconstruction. Far down in the pure depths of his being, among the hidden, untouched currents of his soul, he saw born a voice. He concieved a new world, modelled by the pain of his life, in which no old shadows fell darkening upon the temple of thought. And there were many personal advantages in it.
  <lb/>He thought for a time of piercing orations starting multitudes and of books wrung from his heart. In the gloom of his misery, his eyesight proclaimed that mankind were bowing to wrong and ridiculous idols. He said that if some all-powerful joker should take them away in the night, and leave only manufac�tured shadows falling upon the bended heads, mankind would go on counting the hollow beads of their progress until the shriveling of the fingers. He was a-blaze with desire to change. He saw himself, a sun-lit figure upon a peak, pointing with true and unchangeable gesture. "There"! And all men could see and no man would falter.
  <lb/>Gradually the idea grew upon him that the cattle which cluttered the earth, would, in their ignorance and calm faith in the next day, blunder stolidly on and he would be beating his fists against the brass of accepted things. A remarkable facility for abuse came to him then and in supreme disgust and rage, he railed. To him there was something terrible and awesome in these words spoken from his heart to his heart. He was very tragic.

  <lb/>a moment, and then fall again. His face was of a 
  <lb/>clammy pallor. Deep groans were wrenched from him.
  <lb/>At last with a twisting movement he got upon
  <lb/>his hands and knees <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_92_z019">afrom</del>and from thence, like a

  <lb/>-ing over the grass.
  <lb/>And afterward, Fleming fought an intense 
  <lb/>fight with his body. His dulled senses wished him 
  <lb/>to swoon and he opposed them stubbornly, his mind 
  <lb/>picturing unknown dangers and mutilations if he 
  <lb/>fell upon the field. He went forward, Conklin-fash
  <lb/>-ion.He thought of secluded spots where he could 
  <lb/>fall and be unmolested. To reach <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_92_z015">them</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_92_z014">one</add>, he strove
  <lb/>against the tide of his pain.
  <lb/>He put his hand up to his head and timidly
  <lb/>touched the wound under his hair. The scratching
  <lb/>pain of the contact made him draw a long breath 
  <lb/>through his clenched teeth. His fingers were dabbled 
  <lb/>with blood. He regarded them with a fixed stare.
  <lb/>Around him, he could hear the grumble of jolt

  <lb/>charger near ran him down. He turned and watched 
  <lb/>the artilleryman controlling the mass of cannon, men,
  <lb/>and horses by excited motions of his gauntleted hand.
  <lb/>The guns followed the teams with <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_92_z012">and</del><add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="dStB" facs="#rboc-d_92_z013">a seeming</add> air of
