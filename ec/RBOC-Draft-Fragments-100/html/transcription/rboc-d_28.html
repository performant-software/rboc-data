The enemy would presently encompass them and
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>swallow the whole cammand. He glared about him as if hunted.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>He thought that he must break from the ranks and
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>harangue his comrades. They must not all be killed like pigs.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>And he was sure it would be so. And he was sure it would
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>be so. The general were idiots to send them marching
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>into a regular pen. He would step forth and make
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>a speech. Shrill and passionate words were at his lips.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The line broken into moving fragments by the
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ground went calmly on through fields and woods.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Fleming looked at the men nearest him and saw
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>for the most part, expressions of deep interest as if they
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>were investigating something that had fascinated them.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Some stepped with an over-valiant air as if they were
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>already plunged into war. Others went as upon thin
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ice. The greater part of the untested men seemed appeared
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>quiet and absorbed.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>As he looked, Fleming gripped his out-cry at
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>his throat. He saw that even if they were tottering
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>with fear they would laugh at his oration. They
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>would jeer him and, if practicable, pelt him with
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>missiles. Admitting that he might be wrong, a
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>frenzied declamation of the kind would turn him
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>into a worm.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>He assumed the demeanor of one who is doomed, a-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>knows that he is doomed, alone, to unwritten responsibilities.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Presently, the brigade was halted in the cathedral-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>light of a forest. The busy skirmishers were still
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>popping. Through the aisles of the wood could be
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>seen the floating smoke from their rifles.
