  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>of merriment and agony. As he marched, he sang a bit of doggerel in a high and quavering voice.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"Sing a song of vict'ry"
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"A pocketful a' bullets"
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"Five an' twenty dead men"
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"Baked in a-pie."
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Parts of the procession limped and staggered to this tune.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Another had the grey seal of death already upon his face. His lips were curled in hard lines and his teeth were clenched. His hands were bloody from where he had pressed them upon his wound. He seemed to be awaiting the moment when he should pitch headlong. He stalked like the spectre of a soldier, his eyes burning with the power of a stare into the unknown.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>There were some who proceeded sullenly, full of anger at their wounds and ready to turn upon anything as an obscure cause.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>An officer was carried along by two privates. He was peevish. "Don't joggle so, Johnson, yeh fool," he cried. "Think m' leg is made of iron? If yeh can't carry me decent, leave me down an' let some one else do it."
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>He bellowed at the tottering crowd who blocked the quick march of his bearers. "Say, make way there, cant yeh? Make way, dickens take it all."
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>They sulkily parted and went to the roadsides. As he was carried past, they made pert remarks to him. When he raged in reply and threatened them, they told him to be damned.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The shoulder of one of the tramping bearers knocked heavily against the spectral soldier who was staring into the unknown.
