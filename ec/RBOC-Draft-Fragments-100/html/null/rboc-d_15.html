  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Jim Conklin had been the fast-flying messenger of a
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>mistake. The tale had created in him a great con-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>cern for himself. He now stood confronting the
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>possibilities. and with the new born question in his
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>mind, he was compelled to sink back into his old
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>place as part of a blue demonstration.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>He kept up ceaseless calculations. They were
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>wondrously unsatisfactory. He could establish noth-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ing. He was anxious to prove beyond a doubt
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>that he would not be afraid. He wished to go
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>into the blaze and then figuratively to watch his
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>legs to discover their merits and faults. So he
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>fretted for an opportunity.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>He was continually measuring himself by his
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>comrades. Conklin, for one, re-assured him. The for-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>mer's serene unconcern gave him some confidence
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>because he had known him since childhood and
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>from his intimate knowledge, he did not see how
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Conklin could be capable of anything that was
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>beyond him, Fleming. Still, he thought Conklin
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>might be mistaken about himself. Or, on the
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>other hand, he might be a man heretofore doomed
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>to obscurity in peace but in reality made for war.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>He would have liked to have discovered an-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>other man who suspected himself. A sympathetic
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>comparison of mental notes would have been a
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>great relief to him. He occasionally tried to fathom
