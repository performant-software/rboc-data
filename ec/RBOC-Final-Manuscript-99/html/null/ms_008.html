  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>like you--as aint never been away from home much an' has allus had a mother--an' a-learnin' 'im t' drink an' swear. Keep clear 'a them folks, Henry. I don't want yeh t' ever do any thin', Henry, that yeh would be shamed t' let me know about. Jest think as if I was a-watch in' yeh. If yeh keep that in yer mind allus, I guess yeh'll come out about right.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Young fellers in th' army git awful keerless in their ways, Henry. They're away f'm home an' they don't have nobody t' look atter'em. I'm 'feard fer yeh 'bout that. Yeh aint never been used t' doin' fer yerself. So yeh must keep writin' t' me how yer clothes are lastin'.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Yeh must allus remember yer father, too, child, an' remember he never drunk a drop 'a licker in his life an' seldom swore a cross oath.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>I don't know what else t' tell yeh, Henry, exceptin' that yeh must never do no shirkin', child, on my account. If so be a time comes when yeh have t' be kilt or do a mean thing, why, Henry, don't think of any thin' 'cept what's right, b'cause there's many a woman has to bear up 'ginst sech things these times an' th' Lord'll take keer of us all. Don't fergit t' send yer socks t' me th' minute they git holes in'em an' here's a little bible I want yeh t' take along with yeh, Henry. I dont presume yeh'll be a-settin' readin' it all day long, child, nor nothin' like that.
