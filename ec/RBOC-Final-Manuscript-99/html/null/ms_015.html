  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"Not much it wont," replied the tall soldier exasperated. "Not much it wont. Didn't th' cavalry all start this mornin'?" He glared about him. No one denied his statement. "Th' cavalry started this mornin'," he continued. "They say there aint hardly any cavalry left in camp. They're goin' t' Richmond or some place while we fight all th' Johnnies. It's some dodge like that. Th' reg'ment's got orders, too. A feller what seen'em go t' head-quarters told me a little while ago. An' they're raisin' blazes all over camp--anybody kin see that."
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"Shucks," said the loud one.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The youth remained silent for a time. At last he spoke to the tall soldier. "Jim!"

  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"Think any 'a th' boys'll run?" persisted the youth.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"Oh, there may a few of'em run but there's them kind in every reg'ment, 'specially when they first goes under fire," said the other in a tolerant way. "'A course, it might happen that th' hull kit-an'-boodle might start an' run, if some big fightin' come first-off, an' then a'gin, they might stay an' fight like fun. But yeh cant bet on nothin'. A' course they aint never been under fire yit an' it aint likely they'll lick th' hull rebel army all-t'-onct th' first time, but I think they'll fight better than some, if worser
