  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The ragged line had respite for some minutes but during it's pause, the struggle in the forest became magnified until the trees seemed to quiver from the firing and the ground to shake from the rushings of the men. The voices of the cannon were mingled in a long and interminable row. It seemed difficult to live in such an atmosphere. The chests of the men strained for a bit of freshness and their throats craved water.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>There was one, shot through the body, who raised a cry of bitter lamentation when came this lull. Perhaps, he had been calling out during the fighting also but at that time no one had heard him. But now the men turned at the woful complaints of him upon the ground.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"Who is it? Who is it?"
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"It's Jimmie Rogers! Jimmie Rogers."
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>When their eyes first encountered him there was a sudden halt as if they feared to go near. He was thrashing about in the grass, twisting his shuddering body into many strange postures. He was screaming loudly. This instant's hesitation seemed to fill him with a tremendous, fantastic contempt and he damned them in shreiked sentences.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The youth's friend had a geographical illusion concerning a stream and he obtained permission to go for some water. Immediately, canteens were showered upon him. "Fill mine, will yeh?" "Bring me some, too." "And me, too." He departed, ladened. The youth went with his friend, feeling a desire to throw his heated body into the stream and, soaking there, drink quarts.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>They made a hurried search for the supposed stream but did not find it. "No water here," said the youth. They turned without delay and began to retrace their steps.
