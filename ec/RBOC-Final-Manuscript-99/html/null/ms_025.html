  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>As he mused thus, he heard the rustle of grass and, upon turning his head discovered, the loud soldier. He called out. "Oh, Wilson."
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The latter approached and looked down. "Why, hello, Henry, is it you? What yeh doin' here?"
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"Oh--thinkin'," said the youth.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The other sat down and carefully lighted his pipe. "You're gittin' blue, m' boy. You're lookin' thunderin' peek-ed. What th' dickens is wrong with yeh?"
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"Oh--nothin'," said the youth.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The loud soldier launched then into the subject of the anticipated fight. "Oh, we've got'em now." As he spoke his boyish face was wreathed in a gleeful smile and his voice had an exultant ring. "We've got'em now. At last by th' eternal thunders, we'll lick'em good."
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"If th' truth was known," he added more soberly, "they've licked us about every clip up t' now, but this time--this time, we'll lick'em good."
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"I thought yeh was objectin' t' this march a little while ago," said the youth coldly.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"Oh, it wasn't that," explained the other. "I don't mind marchin' if there's goin.' t' be fightin at th' end of it. What I hate is this gittin' moved here an' moved there with no good comin' of it, as far as I kin see, exceptin' sore feet an' damn' short rations."
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"Well, Jim Conklin says we'll git a-plenty of fightin' this time."
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"He's right fer once, I guess, 'though I can't see how it come. This time we're in for a big battle an' we've got th' best end of it certain-sure. Gee-rod, how we will thump'em."
