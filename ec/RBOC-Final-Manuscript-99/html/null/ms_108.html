  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>little. He was afraid to move rapidly, however, for a 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>dread of disturbing it. He held his head very still and
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>took many precautions against stumbling. He was filled 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>with anxiety and his face was pinched and drawn in 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>anticipation of the pain of any sudden mistake of his
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>feet in the gloom.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>His thoughts, as he walked, fixed intently upon his
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>hurt. There was a cool, liquid feeling about it and he 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>imagined blood moving slowly down under his hair. His head
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>seemed swollen to a size that made <tei-del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_108_z001" data-origname="del">his neck</tei-del> him think
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>his neck to be inadequate.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The new silence of his wound made much worri-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ment. The little, blistering voices of pain that had called 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>out from his scalp, were, he thought, definite in their
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>expression of danger. By them, he believed that he could
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>measure his plight. But when they remained ominously
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>silent, he became frightened and imagined terrible fing-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ers that clutched into his brain.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Amidst it, he began to reflect upon various incidents and
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>conditions of the past. He bethought him of certain meals his 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>mother had cooked at home, in which those dishes of which
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>he was particularly fond had occupied prominent positions.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>He saw the spread table. The pine walls of the kitchen 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>were glowing in the warm light from the stove. Too, he re-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>membered how he and his companions used to go from the
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>schoolhouse to the bank of a shaded pool. He saw his
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>clothes in disorderly array upon the grass of the bank. He 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>felt the swash of the fragrant water upon his body. 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The leaves ot the over-hanging maple rustled with mel-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ody in the wind of youthful summer.
