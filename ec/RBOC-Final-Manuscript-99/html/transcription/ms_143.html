  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Once, he, in his intent hate, was almost alone and was firing when all those near him had ceased. He was so engrossed in his occupation that he was not aware of a lull.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>He was re-called by a hoarse laugh and a sentence that came to his ears in a voice of contempt and amazement. "Yeh infernal fool, don't yeh know enough t' quit when there aint anything t' shoot at? Good Gawd!"

  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Some of the men muttered and looked at the youth in awe-struck ways. It was plain that as he had gone on loading and firing and cursing without the proper intermission, they had found time to regard him. And they now looked upon him as a war-devil.
