  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>	He was not cast-down by this defeat of his plan, for, upon studying <tei-add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_093_z005" data-origname="add">the</tei-add><tei-metamark place="inline" function="caret" rend="ink" change="mStB" facs="#ms_093_z026" data-origname="metamark">^</tei-metamark> affair carefully, he could not but admit that the objections were very formidable.

In their presence, he could not persist in flying high with the red wings of war; they rendered it almost impossible for him to see himself in a heroic light. He tumbled headlong.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>	He discovered that he had a scorching th<tei-del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_093_z008" data-origname="del">r</tei-del>irst.

His feet were like two sores. Also, his body was calling for food. It was more powerful than a direct hunger. There was a dull, weight-like feeling in his stomach and

  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>	While he had been tossed by many emotions, he had not been aware of ailments.
