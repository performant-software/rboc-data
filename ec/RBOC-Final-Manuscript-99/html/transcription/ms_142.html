  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>When, in a dream, it occurred to the youth that his rifle was an impotent stick, he lost sense of everything but his hate, his desire to smash into pulp the glittering smile of victory which he could feel upon the faces of his enemies.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The blue, smoke-swallowed line curled and writhed like a snake, stepped upon. It swung it's ends to and fro in an agony of fear and rage.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The youth was not conscious that he was erect upon his feet. He did not know the direction of the ground. Indeed, once he even lost the habit of balance and fell heavily. He was up again immediately. One thought went through the chaos of his brain at the time. He wondered if he had fallen because he had been shot. But the suspicion flew away at once. He did not think more of it.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>He had taken up a first position behind the little tree with a direct determination to hold it against the world. He had not deemed it possible that his army could that day succeed and, from this, he felt the ability to fight harder. But the throng had surged in all ways until he lost directions and locations, save that he knew where lay the enemy.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The flames bit him and the hot smoke broiled his skin. His rifle-barrel grew so hot that, ordinarily, he could not have born it upon his palms but he kept on stuffing cartridges into it and pounding them with his clanking, bending ram-rod. If he aimed at some changing form through the smoke, he pulled his trigger with a fierce grunt as if he were dealing a blow of the fist with all his strength.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>When the enemy seemed falling back before him and his fellows, he went instantly forward, like a dog who seeing his foes lagging, turns and insists upon being pursued. And when he was compelled to retire again, he did it slowly, sullenly, taking steps of wrathful despair.
