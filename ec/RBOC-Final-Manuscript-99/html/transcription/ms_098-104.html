  out of the woods and down through the fields. He knew at once that
  the steel fibres had been washed from their hearts. They were bursting
  from their coats and their equipments as from entanglements. They
  charged down upon him like terrified buffaloes.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Behind them, blue smoke curled and clouded <tei-restore change="mStA" hand="#SC" facs="#ms_098-104_z030" data-origname="restore">o</tei-restore>above the tree-tops

  The voices of the cannon were clamoring in interminable chorus.

He stared in agony and amazement.
  He forgot that he was engaged in combating the universe. He threw
