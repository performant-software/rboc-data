  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The youth cried out savagely at this statement. He crouched be
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>hind a little tree, with his eyes burning balefully and his teeth
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>set in a cur-like snarl. The awkward bandage was still about 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>his head and, upon it, over his wound there was a spot of dry
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>blood. His hair was wondrously towsled and some strag
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>gling, moving locks hung over the cloth of the bandage down 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>toward his forehead. His jacket and shirt were open at the neck
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>and exposed his young, bronzed neck. There could be seen
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>spasmodic gulpings at his throat.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>His fingers twined nervously about his rifle. He wished
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>that it was an engine of annihilating power. He felt that he and his 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>companions were being taunted and derided from sincere convictions
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>that they were poor and puny. 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>His knowledge of his inability to take vengeance for it made his
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>rage into a dark and stormy spectre that possessed him and
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>made him dream of abominable cruelties. The tormentors were 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>flies sucking insolently at his blood and he thought that he
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>would have given his life for a revenge of seeing their faces
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>in pitiful plights.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The winds of battle had swept all about the regiment
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>until the one rifle, instantly followed by brothers, flashed in
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>it's front. A moment later, the regiment roared forth it's sud
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>den and valiant retort. A dense wall of smoke settled slowly 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>down. It was furiously slit and slashed by the knife-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>like fire from the rifles.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>To the youth, the fighters were like animals tossed for
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>a death-struggle into a dark pit. There was a sen
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>sation that he and fellows, at bay, were pushing back, always
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>pushing fierce onslaughts of creatures who were slippery.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Their beams of crimson seemed to get no purchase upon the
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>bodies of their foes; the latter seemed to evade them with 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ease and come through, between, around and about, with 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>unopposed skill.
