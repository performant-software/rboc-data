  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>accepted the matter. And they mused upon it, with a if hun-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>dred varieties of expression. It was an interesting engrossing 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>thingd to think about. Many tightened their belts carefully
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>and hitched at their trousers.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>A moment later, the officers began to bustle among the
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>men, pushing them into a more compact mass and into a
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>better alignment. They chased those that straggled and fumed at a 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>few men who did seemed to show by their attitudes, that they had decided to re-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>main at that spot. They were like critical sheperds strug-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>gling with sheep.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Presently, the regiment seemed to draw itself up and heave
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>a deep breath. None of the men's faces were mirrors of large
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>thoughts. The soldiers were bended and stooped like sprinters
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>before a signal. Many pairs of glinting eyes peered from the
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>grimey faces toward the curtains of the deeper woods. They
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>seemed to be engaged in deep calculations of time and distance.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>They were surrounded by the noises of the monstrous
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>altercation of between between the two armies. The world was fully inter-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ested in other matters. Apparently, the regiment had it's 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>small affair to itself.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Fleming The youth, turning, shot a quick, enquiring glance til at 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Wilson his friend. The latter returned to him the same manner of
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>look. They were the only ones who possessed an inner know-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ledge. "Mule-drive'rs--hell t' pay--don't believe many 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>will get back." It was an ironical secret. Still, they saw
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>no hesitation in each other's faces and they nodded a
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>mute and unprotesting assent when a shaggy man
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>near them said in a meek voice: "We'll git swallered."
