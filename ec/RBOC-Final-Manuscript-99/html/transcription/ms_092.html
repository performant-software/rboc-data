  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>calmly killed on a high place before the eyes of all. He thought of the magnificent pathos of his dead body.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>These thoughts up-lifted him. He felt the quiver of war-desire. In his ears, he heard the ring of victory. He knew the frenzy of a rapid successful charge. The music of the trampling feet, the sharp voices, the clanking arms of the column near him made him soar on the red wings of war. For a few moments, he was sublime.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>He thought that he was about to start fleetly for the front. Indeed, he saw a picture of himself, dust-stained, haggard, panting, flying to the front at the proper moment to sieze and throttle the dark, leering witch of calamity.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Then the difficulties of the thing began to drag at him. He hesitated, balancing awkwardly on one foot.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>He had no rifle; he could not fight with his hands, said he, resentfully to his plan. Well, rifles could be had for the picking. They were extraordinarily profuse.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Also, he continued, it would be a miracle if he found his regiment. Well, he could fight with any regiment.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>He started forward slowly. He stepped as if he expected to tread upon some explosive thing. Doubts and he were struggling.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>He would truly be a worm if any of his comrades should see him returning thus, the marks of his flight upon him. There was a reply that the intent fighters did not care for what happened rear-word saving that no hostile bayonets appeared there. In the battle-blur his face would, in a way, be hidden like the face of a cowled man.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>But then, he said, that his tireless fate would bring forth, when the strife lulled for a moment, a man to ask of him an explantion. In imagination he felt the scrutiny of his companions as he painfully labored through some lies.
