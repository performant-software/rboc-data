  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The youth, light-footed was unconsciously in advance. His 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>eyes still kept note of the clump of trees. From all places near 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>it the clannish yell of the enemy could be heard. The little 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>flames of rifles leaped from it. The song of the bullets was 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>in the air and shells snarled among the tree-tops. One tum-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>bled directly into the middle of a hurrying group and ex-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ploded in crimson fury. There was an instant's spectacle of 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>a man, almost over it, throwing up his hands to shield his eyes.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Other men, punched by bullets, fell in grotesque agonies. 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The regiment left a coherent trail of bodies.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>They had passed into a clearer atmosphere. There was 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>an effect like a revelation in the new appearance of the 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>landscape. Some men working madly at a battery were 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>plain to them and the opposing infantry's lines were de-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>fined by the grey walls and fringes of smoke.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>It seemed to the youth that he saw everything. Each 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>blade of the green grass was bold and clear. He thought that 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>he was aware of every change in the thin, transparent va-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>por that floated idly m sheets. The brown or grey 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>trunks of the trees showed each roughness of their surfaces. 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>And the men of the regiment, with their starting eyes and 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>sweating faces, running madly, or falling, as if thrown 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>headlong, to queer, heaped up corpses, all were comprehended. 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>His mind took a mechanical but firm impressions, so that, after-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ward, everything was pictured and explained to him, save 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>why he himself was there.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>But there was a frenzy made from this furious rush. 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The men, pitching forward insanely, had burst into cheer-
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>ings, mob-like and barbaric, but tuned in strange 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>keys that can arouse the dullard and the stoic. It made 
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>a mad enthusiasm that, it seemed, would be incapable of
