  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>At this sight, the youth forgot many personal matters and became greatly enraged. He exploded in loud sentence. "B'jiminy, we're generaled by a lot 'a lunkheads."
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"More than one feller has said that t'-day," observed a' man.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>His friend, recently aroused, was still very drowsy. He looked behind him until his mind took in the meaning of the movement. Then he sighed. "Oh, well, I s'pose we got licked," he remarked, sadly.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>The youth had a thought that it would not be handsome for him to freely condemn other men. He made an attempt to restrain himself but the words upon his tongue were too bitter. He presently began a long and intricate denunciation of the cammander of the forces.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"Mebbe, it w'a'nt all his fault--not all together. He did th' best he knowed. It's our luck t' git licked often," said his friend in a weary tone. He was trudging along with stooped shoulders and shifting eyes like a man who has been caned and kicked.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>"Well, don't we fight like th' devil? Don't we do all that men kin?" demanded the youth loudly.
  <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>He was secretly dumb-founded at this sentiment when it came from his lips. For a moment his face lost it's valor and he looked guiltily about him. But no one questioned his right to deal in such words, and, presently, he recovered his air of courage. He went on to repeat a statement he had heard going from group to group at the camp that morning. "Th' brigadier sed he never see a new reg'ment fight th' way we fit yestirday, didnt he? An' we didn't no better than many another reg'ment, did we? Well, then, yeh can't say it's th' army's fault, kin yeh?"
