  <lb/>He had been slow in the act of producing the

  <lb/>As he contemplated him, <del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_132_z013">Fleming</del><metamark place="inline" function="caret" rend="ink" change="mStE" facs="#ms_132_z026">^</metamark>the youth felt his heart grow

  <lb/>He reflected, with condescending pity: "Too bad! Too
  <lb/>bad! Th' poor devil, it makes him feel tough!"
  <lb/>After this incident, and as he reviewed the battle-<del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_132_z016">scenes</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_132_z015">pictures</add>

  <lb/>He saw his gapeing audience picturing him as the

  <lb/>consternation and the ejaculation<add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_132_z030">s</add> of his mother and the
