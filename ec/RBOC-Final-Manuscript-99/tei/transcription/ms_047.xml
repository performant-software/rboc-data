  <lb/>at a menacing fate. He became not a man but a member. He felt 
  <lb/>that something of which he was a part--a regiment, an army, 
  <lb/>a cause, or a country--was in a crisis. He was welded into a 
  <lb/>common personality which was dominated by a single desire. For 
  <lb/>moments, he could not flee no more than a little finger can

  <lb/>If he had thought the regiment about to be annihilated 
  <lb/>perhaps he could have amputated himself from it. But it's noise 
  <lb/>gave him assurance. The regiment was like a fire-work that, once 
  <lb/>ignited, proceeds superior to circumstances until it's blazing vital-
  <lb/>ity fades. It wheezed and banged with a mighty power. He 
  <lb/>pictured the ground before it as strewn with the discomfited.
