  <lb/>He arose and began to pace to and fro excitedly. The thrill of his enthusiasm made him walk with an elastic step. He was sprightly, vigorous, fiery in his belief in success. He looked into the future with clear, proud eye. And he swore with the air of an old soldier.
  <lb/>The youth watched him for a moment in silence. When he finally spoke, his voice was as bitter as dregs. "Oh, you're gain' t' do great things, I s'pose."
  <lb/>The loud soldier blew a thoughtful cloud of smoke from his pipe. "Oh, I don't know," he remarked with dignity. "I don't know. I s'pose I'll do as well as th' rest. I'm goin' t' try like thunder." He evidently complimented himself upon the modesty of this statement.

  <lb/>"Run?" said the loud one. "Run? Of course not." He laughed.
  <lb/>"Well," continued the youth, "lots of good-a-'nough men have thought they was gain' t' do great things before th' fight but when th' time come, they skedaddled."

An' I am, too. Who are you, anyhow? You talk as if yeh thought yeh was Napolyon Bonypart." He glared at the youth for a moment and then strode away.
