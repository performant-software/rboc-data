  <lb/>smiled briefly when he saw men dodge and duck at the long 
  <lb/>screechings of shells that were thrown in giant handfuls over
  <lb/>them. He stood, erect and tranquil, watching the attack be-
  <lb/>gin against a part of the line that made a blue curve along
  <lb/>the side of an adjacent hill. <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_173_z005">Unmole</del>His vision being unmolested

  <lb/>little separate <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_173_z014">battle</add> with two other regiments. It was in a cleared
  <lb/>space, wearing a set-apart look. They were blazing as if upon
  <lb/>a wager, giving and taking tremendous blows. The firings
  <lb/>were incredibly fierce and rapid. These intent regiments ap-
  <lb/>parently were oblivious of all larger purposes of war and were
  <lb/>slugging each other as if at a matched game.
  <lb/>In another direction, he saw a magnificent brigade
  <lb/>going with the evident intention of driving the enemy from a
  <lb/>wood. They passed in out of sight and presently there was
  <lb/>a most, awe-inspiring racket in <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_173_z015">the</add><del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_173_z016">that</del> wood. <del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_173_z017">They passed in</del>
