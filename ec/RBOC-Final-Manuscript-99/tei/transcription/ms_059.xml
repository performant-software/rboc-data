  <lb/>appearance of a business man whose market is swinging up and down.
  <lb/>The youth went slinking around this spot. He went as near as he dared trying to over-hear words. Perhaps the general, unable to comprehend chaos might call upon him for information. And he could tell him. He knew all concerning it. Of a surety the force was in a fix and any fool could see that if they did not retreat while they had opportunity--why--
  <lb/>He felt that he would like to thrash the general, or, at least, approach and tell him in plain words exactly what he thought him to be. It was criminal to stay calmly in one spot and make no effort to stay destruction. He loitered in a fever of eagerness for the division-cammander to apply to him.
  <lb/>As he warily moved about, he heard the general call out irritably. "Tompkins, go over an' see Taylor an' tell him not t' be in such all-fired hurry--tell him t' halt his brigade in th' edge of th' woods--tell him t' detach a reg'ment--say I think th' centre'll break if we don't help it out some--tell him t' hurry up."
  <lb/>A slim youth on a fine chestnut horse caught these swift words from the mouth of his superior. He made his horse bound into a gallop almost from a walk in his haste to go upon his mission. There was a cloud of dust.
  <lb/>A moment later, the youth saw the general bounce excitedly in his saddle.
  <lb/>"Yes--by Heavens--they have!" The officer leaned forward. His face was a-flame with excitement. "Yes, by Heavens, they've held'im! They've held'im."
  <lb/>He began to blithely roar at his staff.
