  <lb/>thick shirts. Presently, few carried anything but their
  <lb/>necessary clotheing, <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_029_z003">two</del> blankets, haversack<add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_029_z004">s</add>, <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_029_z005">canteens,</add> and arms
  <lb/>and ammunition. "Yeh kin now eat, drink, sleep an' shoot," said the tall soldier to the youth. "That's all yeh need. What d' yeh wanta do--carry a hotel?"
  <lb/>There was sudden change from the
  <lb/>ponderous infantry of theory to the light and speedy
  <lb/>infantry of practise. The regiment, relieved of a
  <lb/>burden, recieved a new impetus. But there was
  <lb/><del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_029_z009">a</del> much loss of valuable knapsacks and, on the
  <lb/>whole, very good shirts.
  <lb/>But the regiment<del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_029_z010">s</del> was not yet ^ <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_029_z012">by any means</del> veteran-like
  <lb/>in appearance<del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_029_z013">s</del>. Veteran regiments in this army
  <lb/>were like <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_029_z014">tw</del> to be very small aggregations of
  <lb/>men. Once, when the<del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_029_z015">y</del> ^ <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_029_z016">cammand</add> had first come to the
  <lb/>field, some perambulating veterans, <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_029_z018">seein</del> noting
  <lb/>the length of the<add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_029_z019">ir</add> column, had accosted them thus:
  <lb/>"Hay, fellers, what brigade is that?" And when
  <lb/>the men had replied that they formed a regiment
  <lb/>and not a brigade, the older soldiers had laughed
  <lb/>and said: "Oh, Gawd!"
  <lb/>Also, there was too great a similarity in
  <lb/>the <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_029_z020">hats.</add> <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_029_z021">head gear.</del> - The hats of a regiment should prop-
  <lb/>erly represent the history of head-gear for a
  <lb/>period of years.
  <lb/>And, moreover, there was no letters of faded
  <lb/>gold speaking from the colors. They were new
  <lb/>and beautiful, and the color-bearer habitually
  <lb/>oiled the pole.
  <lb/>Presently, <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_029_z023">Fleming</del> <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_029_z025">had</del> <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_029_z022"><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_029_z022">the youth</add></del> ^ <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_029_z024">the army</add> again sat down to

  <lb/>was in the men's nostrils. The sound of monoton-
