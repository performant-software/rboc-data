  <lb/>When the two youths turned with the flag, they saw that

  <lb/>was coming <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_158_z033">s</add>lowly back. The men having hurled themselves in
  <lb/>projectile-fashion, had presently expended their forces. They

  <lb/>woods and their hot rifles still replying to the din. Sev-
  <lb/>eral officers were giving orders, their voices keyed to screams.
  <lb/>"Where in hell yeh goin'?" the <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_158_z009">youthful</del>lieutenant was
  <lb/>asking in a sarcastic howl. And a red-bearded officer,
  <lb/>whose voice of triple brass could plainly be heard, was cam-
  <lb/>manding: "Shoot in to'em! Shoot in to'em, <add place="inline" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_158_z010">Gawd</add> <metamark place="inline" function="caret" rend="ink" change="mStE" facs="#ms_158_z044">^</metamark>damn their souls."
  <lb/>There was a melee of speeches in which the men were <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_158_z039">or-</add> 
  <lb/>-dered to do conflicting and impossible things.

  <lb/>"Give it t' me." "No--let me keep it." Each felt satisfied with 
  <lb/>the other's possession of it but each felt bound to declare by

  <lb/>risk himself. <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_158_z031">Fleming</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_158_z030">The youth</add> roughly pushed his friend away.
