  <lb/>"Yes," said <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_072_z006">Fleming</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_072_z007">the youth</add> shortly. He quickened his pace.
  <lb/>But the other hobbled industriously after him. There was
  <lb/>an air of apology in his manner but he evidently thought
  <lb/>that he needed only <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_072_z015"><metamark place="inline" function="caret" rend="ink" change="mStB" facs="#ms_072_z029">^</metamark>to</add> talk for a <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_072_z008">little</del> time and Fleming

  <lb/>of love for the army which was to him all
  <lb/>things beautiful and powerful.
