  <lb/>The regiment marched until it had joined it's fellows. The
  <lb/>re-formed brigade, in column, aimed through a wood at the road.
  <lb/>Directly they were in a mass of dust-covered troops and were trudging
  <lb/>along in a way paralell to the enemy's lines, as these had been de-
  <lb/>fined by the previous turmoil.
  <lb/>They passed within view of the stolid white house and saw
  <lb/>in front of it, groups of their comrades lieing <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_186_z008">down</del> in wait be-
  <lb/>hind a neat breastwork. A row of guns were booming at a
  <lb/>distant enemy. Shells thrown in reply were raising clouds of
  <lb/>dust and splinters. Horsemen dashed along the line of <subst facs="#ms_186_z024"><del rend="overwrite ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_186_z024">i</del><add place="inline" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_186_z024">e</add></subst>n-

  <lb/>lapitated regiment procured the captured flag from the Wilson
  <lb/>and, tossing it high into the air cheered tumultuously as it
  <lb/>turned, with apparent reluctance, slowly over and over.
  <lb/>At this point of it's march, the division curved away
  <lb/>from the field and went winding off in the direction of the river.
  <lb/>When the significance of this movement had impressed itself
  <lb/>upon <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_186_z010">Fleming</del> <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_186_z009">the youth</add>, he turned his head and looked over his shoul-

  <lb/>For a time, <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_186_z015">Fleming</del> <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_186_z014">the youth</add> was obliged to reflect in a puzzled
