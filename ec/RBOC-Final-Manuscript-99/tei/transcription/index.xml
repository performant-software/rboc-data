<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_001"/><ab>  <lb/>The cold passed reluctantly from the earth and 
  <lb/>the retiring fogs revealed an army stretched out on the hills,
  <lb/>resting. As the landscape changed from brown to 
  <lb/>green the army awakened and began to tremble 
  <lb/>with eagerness at the noise of rumors. It cast 
  <lb/>it's eyes upon the roads which were growing
  <lb/>from long <del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_001-0012">red th</del> troughs of liquid mud to 
  <lb/>proper thoroughfares. A river, amber-tinted in 
  <lb/>the shadow of it's banks, purled at the army's 
  <lb/>feet and at night when the stream had become 
  <lb/>of a sorrowful blackness one could see, across, 
  <lb/>the red eye-like gleam of hostile camp-fires 
  <lb/>set in the low brows of distant hills.
  <lb/>Once, a <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStA" facs="#ms_001-0008">Jim Conklin</del> certain tall soldier developed virtues and 
  <lb/>went resolutely to wash a shirt. He came fly-
  <lb/>ing back from a brook waving his garment, ban-
  <lb/>ner-like. He was swelled with a tale he had 
  <lb/>heard from a reliable friend who had heard it 
  <lb/>from a truthful cavalryman who had heard 
  <lb/>it from his trust-worthy brother, one of the orderlies 
  <lb/>at division head-quarters. <del rend="multistrikethrough pencil" hand="#SC" change="dStA" facs="#ms_001-0006">Conklin</del> <add place="above" rend="no-caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="dStA" facs="#ms_001-0007">He</add> adopted the im-

  <lb/>"We're goin' t' move t'morrah--sure," he said

"We're goin' 'way up th' river, cut across, an' come around in behint'em."
  <lb/>To his attentive audience he drew a loud and elaborate plan of a very brilliant campaign. When he had finished, the blue clothed men scattered into small arguing groups between the rows of squat brown huts. A negro teamster who had been dancing upon a cracker-box with the hilarious encouragement of two-score soldiers, was deserted. He sat mournfully down. Smoke drifted lazily from a multitude of quaint chimneys.
  <lb/>"It's a lie--that's all it is. A thunderin' lie," said another private loudly. His smooth face was flushed and his hands were thrust sulkily into his trouser's pockets. He took the matter as an affront to him. "I don't believe th' derned ol' army's ever goin' t' move. We're sot. I've got ready t' move eight times in th' last two weeks an' we aint moved yit."
  <lb/>The tall soldier felt called upon to defend the truth of a rumor he himself had introduced. He and the loud one came near to fighting over it.
  <lb/>A corporal began to swear before the assemblage. He had just put a costly board floor in his house, he said. During the early spring he had refrained from adding extensively to the comfort of his environment because he had felt that the army might start on the march at any moment.
</ab><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_003"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>Of late, however, he had been impressed that they were in a sort of eternal camp.
  <lb/>Many of the men engaged in a spirited debate. One out-lined in a peculiarly lucid manner all the plans of the cammanding general. He was opposed by men who advocated that there were other plans of campaign. They clamored at each other, numbers making futile bids for the popular attention. The while, the soldier who had fetched the rumor bustled about with much importance. He was continually assailed by questions.
  <lb/>"What's up, Jim?"
  <lb/>"Th' army's goin' t' move."
  <lb/>"Ah, what yeh talkin' about? How yeh know it is?"
  <lb/>"Well, yeh kin b'lieve me er not--jest as yeh like. I don't care a hang. I tell yeh what I know an' yeh kin take it er leave it. Suit yerselves. It dont make no difference t' me."
  <lb/>There was much food for thought in the manner in which he replied. He came near to convincing them by disdaining to produce proofs. They grew much excited over it.
  <lb/>There was a youthful private who listened with eager ears to the words of the tall soldier and to the varied comments of his comrades. After recieving a fill of discussions concerning marches and attacks he went to his hut and crawled through an intricate hole that served it as a door. He wished to be alone with some new thoughts that had lately come to him.

  <lb/>He lay down on a wide bunk that stretched across the end of the room. In the other end, cracker boxes were made to serve as furniture. They were grouped about the fire-place. A picture from an illustrated weekly was upon the log walls and three rifles were paralleled on pegs. Equipments hung on handy projections and some tin dishes lay upon a small pile of fire-wood. A folded tent was serving as a roof. The sun-light, without, beating upon it, made it glow a light yellow shade. A small window shot an oblique square of whiter light upon the cluttered floor. The smoke from the fire at times neglected the clay-chimney and wreathed into the room. And this flimsy chimney of clay and sticks made endless threats to set a-blaze the whole establishment.
  <lb/>The youth was in a little trance of astonishment. So they were at last going to fight. On the morrow perhaps there would be a battle and he would be in it. For a time, he was obliged to labor to make himself believe. He could not accept with assurance an omen that he was about to mingle in one of those great affairs of the earth.
  <lb/>He had of course dreamed of battles all of his life--of vague and bloody conflicts that had thrilled him with their sweep and fire. In visions, he had seen himself in many struggles. He had imagined peoples secure in the shadow of his eagle-eyed prowess. But awake he had regarded battles as crimson blotches on the pages of the past.
</ab><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_005"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>He had put them as things of the bygone with his thought-images of heavy crowns and high castles. There was a portion of the world's history which he had regarded as the time of wars, but, it, he thought, had been long gone over the horizon and had disappeared forever.
  <lb/>From his home his youthful eyes had looked upon the war in his own country with distrust. It must be some sort of a play affair. He had long despaired of witnessing a Greek-like struggle. Such would be no more, he had said. Men were better, or, more timid. Secular and religious education had effaced the throat-grappling instinct, or, else, firm finance held in check the passions.
  <lb/>He had burned several times to enlist. Tales of great movements shook the land. They might not be distinctly Homeric, but there seemed to be much glory in them. He had read of marches, sieges, conflicts, and he had longed to see it all. His busy mind had drawn for him large pictures, extravagant in color, lurid with breathless deeds.
  <lb/>But his mother had discouraged him. She had affected to look with some contempt upon the quality of his war-ardor and patriotism. She could calmly seat herself and with no apparent difficulty give him many hundreds of reasons why he was of vastly more importance on the farm than on the field of battle. She had, had certain ways of expression that told that her statements on the subject came from a deep conviction. Besides, on her side, was his
</ab><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_006"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>belief that her ethicical motive in the argument was impregnable.
  <lb/>At last, however, he had made firm rebellion against this yellow light thrown upon the color of his ambitions. The newspapers, the gossip of the village, his own picturings, had aroused him to an uncheckable degree. They were in truth fighting finely down there. Almost every day, the newspapers printed accounts of a decisive victory.
  <lb/>One night, as he lay in bed, the winds had carried to him the clangoring of the church-bell as some enthusiast jerked the rope frantically to tell the twisted news of a great battle. This voice of the people, rejoicing in the night, had made him shiver in a prolonged ecstasy of excitement. Later, he had gone down to his mother's room and had spoken thus: "Ma, I'm gain' t' enlist."
  <lb/>"Henry, don't you be a fool," his mother had replied. She had then covered her face with the quilt. There was an end to the matter for that night.
  <lb/>Nevertheless, the next morning, he had gone to a considerable town that was near his mother's farm and had enlisted in a company that was forming there. When he had returned home, his mother was milking the brindle cow. Four others stood waiting.
  <lb/>"Ma, I've enlisted," he had said to her diffidently.
  <lb/>There was a short silence. "Th' Lord's will be done, Henry," she had finally replied and had then continued to milk the brindle cow.
</ab><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_007"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>When he had stood in the door-way with his soldier's clothes on his back and with the light of excitement and expectancy in his eyes almost defeating the glow of regret for the home bonds, he had seen two tears leaving their hot trails on his mother's scarred cheeks.
  <lb/>Still, she had disappointed him by saying nothing whatever about returning with his shield or on it. He had privately primed himself for a beautiful scene. He had prepared certain sentences which he thought could be used with touching effect. But her words destroyed his plans. She had doggedly peeled potatoes and addressed him as follows: "You watch out, Henry, an' take good keer of yerself in this here fightin' business--you watch out an' take good keer of yerself. Don't go a-thinkin yeh kin lick th' hull rebel army at th' start, b'cause yeh can't. Yer jest one little feller 'mongst a hull lot 'a others an' yeh've got t' keep quiet an' do what they tell yeh. I know how you are, Henry.
  <lb/>I've knet yeh eight pair a' socks, Henry, an' I've put in all yer best shirts, b'cause I want my boy t' be jest as warm an' comf'able as anybody in th' army. Whenever they git holes in'em I want yeh t' send'em right-away back t' me, s'os I kin dern'em.
  <lb/>An' allus be keerful an' choose yer comp'ny. There's lots 'a bad men in the army, Henry. Th' army makes'em wild an' they like nothin' better than th' job of leadin' off a young fellah
</ab><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_008"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>like you--as aint never been away from home much an' has allus had a mother--an' a-learnin' 'im t' drink an' swear. Keep clear 'a them folks, Henry. I don't want yeh t' ever do any thin', Henry, that yeh would be shamed t' let me know about. Jest think as if I was a-watch in' yeh. If yeh keep that in yer mind allus, I guess yeh'll come out about right.
  <lb/>Young fellers in th' army git awful keerless in their ways, Henry. They're away f'm home an' they don't have nobody t' look atter'em. I'm 'feard fer yeh 'bout that. Yeh aint never been used t' doin' fer yerself. So yeh must keep writin' t' me how yer clothes are lastin'.
  <lb/>Yeh must allus remember yer father, too, child, an' remember he never drunk a drop 'a licker in his life an' seldom swore a cross oath.
  <lb/>I don't know what else t' tell yeh, Henry, exceptin' that yeh must never do no shirkin', child, on my account. If so be a time comes when yeh have t' be kilt or do a mean thing, why, Henry, don't think of any thin' 'cept what's right, b'cause there's many a woman has to bear up 'ginst sech things these times an' th' Lord'll take keer of us all. Don't fergit t' send yer socks t' me th' minute they git holes in'em an' here's a little bible I want yeh t' take along with yeh, Henry. I dont presume yeh'll be a-settin' readin' it all day long, child, nor nothin' like that.
</ab><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_009"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>Many a time, yeh'l! fergit yeh got it, I don't doubt. But there'll be many a time, too, Henry, when yeh'll be wantin' advice, boy, an' all like that, an' there'll be nobody round, p'rhaps, t' tell yeh things. Then if yeh take it out, boy, yeh'll find wisdom in it--wisdom in it, Henry--with little or no searchin'. Don't forgit about th' socks an' th' shirts, child, an' I've put a cup of blackberry jam with yer bundle b'cause I know yeh like it above all things. Good-bye, Henry. Watch out an' be a good boy."
  <lb/>He had of course been impatient under the ordeal of this speech. It had not been quite what he expected and he had borne it with an air of irritation. He departed feeling vague relief.
  <lb/>Still, when he had looked back from the gate, he had seen his mother kneeling among the potato-parings. Her brown face, up-raised, was stained with tears and her spare form was quivering. He bowed his head and went on, feeling suddenly ashamed of his purposes.
  <lb/>From his home, he had gone to the seminary to bid adieu to many schoolmates. They had thronged about him with wonder and admiration. He had felt the gulf now between them and had swelled with calm pride. He and some of his fellows who had donned blue were quite over-whelmed with
</ab><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_010"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>priveleges for all of one afternoon and it had been a very delicious thing. They had strutted.
  <lb/>A certain light-haired girl had made vivacious fun at his martial-spirit but there was another and darker girl whom he had gazed at steadfastly and he thought she grew demure and sad at sight of his blue and brass. As he had walked down the path between the rows of oaks, he had turned his head and detected her at a window watching his departure. As he percieved her, she had immediately begun to stare up through the high tree branches at the sky. He had seen a good deal of flurry and haste as she changed her attitude. He often thought of it.
  <lb/>On the way to Washington, his spirit had soared. The regiment was fed and caressed at station after station until the youth had believed that he must be a hero. There was a lavish expenditure of bread and cold meats, coffee, and pickles and cheese. As he basked in the smiles of the girls and was patted and complimented by the old men, he had felt growing within him the strength to do mighty · deeds of arms.
  <lb/>After complicated journeyings with many pauses, there had come months of monotonous life in a camp. He had had the belief that real war was a series of death-struggles with small time in between for sleep and meals but since his regiment had come to the field, the army had done little but sit still and try to keep warm.
</ab><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_011"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>He was brought then gradually back to his old ideas. Greek-like struggles would be no more. Men were better, or more timid. Secular and religious education had effaced the throat-grappling instinct or else firm finance held in check the passions.
  <lb/>He had grown to regard himself merely as a part of a vast blue demonstration. His province was to look out, as far as he could, for his personal comfort. For recreation, he could twiddle his thumbs and speculate on the thoughts which must agitate the minds of the generals. Also, he was drilled and drilled and reviewed, and drilled and drilled and reviewed.
  <lb/>The only foes he had seen were some pickets along the river bank. They were a sun-tanned, philosophical lot who sometimes shot reflectively at the blue pickets. When reproached for this, afterwards, they usually expressed sorrow and swore by their gods that the guns had exploded without permission. Fleming on guard duty one night, conversed across the stream with one. He was a slightly ragged man who spat skilfully between his shoes and possessed a great fund of bland and infantile assurance. Fleming liked him personally.
  <lb/>"Yank," the other had informed him, "yer a right dum good feller." This sentiment, floating to him upon the still air, had made him temporarily regret war.
  <lb/>Various veterans had told Fleming tales. Some talked of grey, be-whiskered hordes who were advancing, with relentless curses and chewing tobacco with unspeakable
</ab><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_012"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>valor; tremendous bodies of fierce soldiery who were sweeping along like the Huns. Others spoke of tattered and eternally-hungry men who fired despondent powder. "They'll charge through hell's-fire an' brimstone t' git a holt on a haversack, an' sech stomachs aint a-lastin' long," he was told. From the stories, Fleming imagined the red, live bones sticking out through slits in the faded uniforms.
  <lb/>Still he could not put a whole faith in veteran's tales, for recruits were their prey. They talked much of smoke, fire, and blood but he could not tell how much might be lies. They persistently yelled "Fresh fish ," at him and were in no wise to be trusted.
  <lb/>However, he percieved now that it did not greatly matter what kind of soldiers he was going to fight, so long as they fought, which fact no one disputed. There was a more serious problem. He lay in his bunk pondering upon it. He tried to mathematically prove to himself that he would not run from a battle.
  <lb/>Previously, he had never felt obliged to wrestle too seriously with this question. In his life, he had taken certain things for granted, never challenging his belief in ultimate success and bothering little about means and roads. But here he was confronted with a thing of moment. It had suddenly appeared to him that perhaps in a
</ab><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_013"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>battle he might run. He was forced to admit that as far as war was concerned he knew nothing of himself.
  <lb/>A sufficent time before, he would have allowed the problem to kick it's heels at the outer portals of his mind but, now, he felt compelled to give serious attention to it.
  <lb/>A little panic-fear grew in his mind. As his imagination went forward to a fight, he saw hideous possibilities. He contemplated the lurking menaces of the future and failed in an effort to see himself standing stoutly in the midst of them. He re-called his visions of broken-bladed glory but in the shadow of the impending tumult, he suspected them to be impossible pictures.
  <lb/>He sprang from the bunk and began to pace nervously to and fro. "Good Lord, whats th' matter with me," he said aloud.
  <lb/>He felt that in this crisis his laws of life were useless. Whatever he had learned of himself was here of no avail. He was an unknown quantity. He saw that he would again be obliged to experiment as he had in early youth. He must accumulate information of himself and, meanwhile, he resolved to remain close upon his guard lest those qualities of which he knew nothing should everlastingly disgrace him. "Good Lord," he repeated in dismay.
  <lb/>After a time, the
</ab><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_014"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>tall soldier slid dexterously through the hole. The loud private followed. They were wrangling.
  <lb/>"That's all right," said the tall soldier as he entered. He waved his hand expressively. "Yeh kin b'lieve me er not--jest as yeh like. All yeh got t' do is t' sit down an' wait as quiet as yeh kin. Then pretty soon yeh'll find out I was right."
  <lb/>His comrade grunted stubbornly. For a moment he seemed to be searching for a formidable reply. Finally he said: "Well, yeh don't know every thin' in th' world, do yeh?"
  <lb/>"Didn't say I knew everythin' in the world," retorted the other sharply. He began to stow various articles snugly into his knap-sack.
  <lb/>The youth, pausing in his nervous walk, looked down at the busy figure. "Coin' t' be a battle, sure, is there, Jim?" he asked.
  <lb/>"Of course there is," replied the tall soldier. "Of course there is. You jest wait 'til t'morrah an' you'll sec one of th' bigges' battles ever was. You jest wait."
  <lb/>"Thunder," said the youth.
  <lb/>"Oh, you'll see fightin' this time, m' boy, what'll be reg'lar out-an'-out fightin'," added the tall soldier with the air of a man who is about to exhibit a battle for the benefit of his friends.
  <lb/>"Huh," said the loud one from a corner.
  <lb/>"Well," remarked the youth, "like as not this story'll turn out jest like them others did.
</ab><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_015"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>"Not much it wont," replied the tall soldier exasperated. "Not much it wont. Didn't th' cavalry all start this mornin'?" He glared about him. No one denied his statement. "Th' cavalry started this mornin'," he continued. "They say there aint hardly any cavalry left in camp. They're goin' t' Richmond or some place while we fight all th' Johnnies. It's some dodge like that. Th' reg'ment's got orders, too. A feller what seen'em go t' head-quarters told me a little while ago. An' they're raisin' blazes all over camp--anybody kin see that."
  <lb/>"Shucks," said the loud one.
  <lb/>The youth remained silent for a time. At last he spoke to the tall soldier. "Jim!"
  <lb/>"What?"
  <lb/>"How d' yeh think th' reg'ment'll do?"
  <lb/>"Oh, they'll fight all right, I guess, after they onct git inteh it," said the other with cold judgment. He made a fine use of the third person. "There's been heaps 'a fun poked at'em b'cause they're new, 'a course, an' all that, but they'll fight all right, I guess."
  <lb/>"Think any 'a th' boys'll run?" persisted the youth.
  <lb/>"Oh, there may a few of'em run but there's them kind in every reg'ment, 'specially when they first goes under fire," said the other in a tolerant way. "'A course, it might happen that th' hull kit-an'-boodle might start an' run, if some big fightin' come first-off, an' then a'gin, they might stay an' fight like fun. But yeh cant bet on nothin'. A' course they aint never been under fire yit an' it aint likely they'll lick th' hull rebel army all-t'-onct th' first time, but I think they'll fight better than some, if worser
</ab><milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_016"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>than others. That's th' way I figger. They call th' reg'ment 'Fresh fish', an' everythin', but th' boys come a' good stock an' most 'a 'em'll fight like sin after-they-onct-git-shootin'," he added with a mighty emphasis on the four last words.
  <lb/>"Oh, you think you know--" began the loud soldier with scorn.
  <lb/>The other turned savagely upon him. They had a rapid altercation, in which they fastened upon each other various strange epithets.
  <lb/>The youth at last interrupted them. "Did yeh ever think yeh might run yerself, Jim?" he asked. On concluding the sentence he laughed as if he had meant to aim a joke. The loud soldier also giggled.
  <lb/>The tall private waved his hand. "Well," said he profoundly, "I've thought it might git too hot fer Jim Conklin in some 'a them scrimmages an' if a hull lot a' boys started an' run, why, I s'pose I'd start an' run. An' if I onct started t' run, I'd run like th' devil an' no mistake. But if everybody was a-standin' an' a-fightin', why, I'd stand an' fight. B'jiminy, I would. I'll bet on it."
  <lb/>"Huh," said the loud one.
  <lb/>The youth of this tale felt gratitude for these words of his comrade. He had feared that all of the untried men possessed a great and correct confidence. He now was, in a measure, re-assured.
</ab><milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_017"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>II
  <lb/>The next morning, the youth discovered that his tall comrade had been the fast-flying messenger of a mistake. There was much scoffing at the latter by those who had yesterday been firm adherents of his views, and there was, even, a little sneering by men who had never believed the rumor. The tall one fought with a man from Chatfield Corners and beat him severely.
  <lb/>The youth felt however that his problem was in no wise lifted from him. There was, on the contrary, an irritating prolongation. The tale had created in him a great concern for himself. Now, with the new-born question in his mind he was compelled to sink back into his old place as part of a blue demonstration.
  <lb/>For days, he made ceaseless calculations, but they were all wondrously unsatisfoctory. He found that he could establish nothing. He finally concluded that the only way to prove himself was to go into the blaze and then figuratively to watch his legs to discover their merits and faults. He reluctantly admitted that he could not sit still and, with a mental slate and pencil, derive an answer. To gain it, he must have blaze, blood and danger, even as a chemist requires this, that and the other. So, he fretted for an opportunity:
  <lb/>Meanwhile, he continually tried to measure himself by his comrades. The tall soldier, for one, gave him some assurance. This man's serene unconcern dealt him a measure of confidence for
</ab><milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_018"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>he had know him since childhood and from his 
  <lb/>intimate knowledge he did not see how he could be capable of anything that was beyond him, the youth. Still, he thought that his comrade might be mistaken about himself. Or, on the other hand, he might be a man heretofore doomed to peace and obscurity but, in reality, made to shine in war.

  <lb/>From off in the darkness, came the trampling of feet. Fleming could occasionally see dark shadows that moved like monsters. The regiment stood at rest for what seemed a long time. The youth grew impatient. It was unendurable, the way these affairs were managed. He wondered how long they were to be kept waiting.
  <lb/>As he looked all about him and pondered upon the mystic gloom, he began to believe that at any moment the ominous distance might be a-flare and the rolling crashes of an engagement come to his ears. Staring, once, at the red eyes across the river, he concieved them to be growing larger, as the orbs of a row of dragons, advancing. He turned toward the colonel and saw him lift his gigantic arm and calmly stroke his moustache.
  <lb/>At last, he heard from along the road at the foot of the hill the clatter of a horse's galloping hoofs. It must be the coming of orders. He bended forward scarce breatheing. The exciting clickety-click as it grew louder and louder seemed to be beating upon his soul. Presently, a horseman with jangling equipment, drew rein before the colonel of the regiment. The two held a short, sharp-worded conversation. The men in the foremost ranks craned their necks.
  <lb/>As the horseman wheeled his animal and galloped away, he turned to shout over his ·shoulder. "Don't forget that box of cigars." The colonel mumbled in reply. The youth wondered what a box of cigars had to do with war.
  <lb/>A moment later the regiment went swinging off into the darkness. It was now like one of those moving monsters wending with many

  <lb/>feet. The air was heavy and cold with dew. A mass of wet grass, marched upon, rustled like silk.
  <lb/>There was an occasional flash and glimmer of steel from the backs of all these huge crawling reptiles. From the road, came creakings and grumblings as some surly guns were dragged away.
  <lb/>The men stumbled along still muttering speculations. There was a subdued debate. Once, a man fell down and as he reached for his rifle, a comrade, unseeing, trod upon his hand. He of the injured fingers swore bitterly and aloud. A low, tittering laugh went among his fellows.
  <lb/>Presently, they passed into a road-way and marched along with easy strides. A dark regiment moved before them, and, from behind, also, came the tinkle of equipments on the bodies marching men.
  <lb/>The rushing yellow of the developing day went on behind their backs. When the sun-rays at last struck full and mellowingly upon the earth, the youth saw that the landscape was streaked with two long, thin, black columns which disappeared on the brow of a hill in front and rear-ward vanished in a wood. They were like two serpents crawling from the cavern of the night.
  <lb/>The river was not in view. The tall soldier burst out in praise of what he thought to be his powers of perception.
</ab><milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_022"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>Some of the tall one's companions cried with emphasis that they too had evolved the same thing and they congratulated themselves upon it. But there were others who said that the tall one's plan was not the true one at all. They persisted with other theories. There was a vigorous discussion.
  <lb/>The youth. took no part in them. As he walked along in careless line, he was engaged with his own eternal debate. He could not hinder himself from dwelling upon it. He was despondent and sullen and threw shifting glances about him. He looked ahead often expecting to hear from the advance the rattle of firing.
  <lb/>But the long serpents crawled slowly from hill to hill without bluster of smoke. A dun-colored cloud of dust floated away to the right. The sky over-head was of a fairy blue.
  <lb/>The youth studied the faces of his companions, ever on the watch to detect kindred emotions. He suffered disappointment. Some ardor of the air which was causing the veteran cammands to move with glee, almost with song, had infected the new regiment. The men began to speak of victory as of a thing they knew. Also, the tall soldier recieved his vindication. They were certainly going to come around in behint the enemy. They expressed commiseration for that part of the army which had been left upon the river-bank felicitating themselves upon being a part of a blasting host.
</ab><milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_023"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>The youth, considering himself as separated from the others, was saddened by the blithe and merry speeches that went from rank to rank. The company wags all made their best endeavors. The regiment tramped to the tune of laughter.
  <lb/>The loud soldier often convulsed whole files by his biting sarcasms aimed at the tall one.
  <lb/>And it was not long before all the men seemed to forget their mission. Whole brigades grinned in unison and regiments laughed.
  <lb/>A rather fat soldier attempted to pilfer a horse from a door-yard. He planned to load his knapsack upon it. He was escaping with his prize when a young girl rushed from the house and grabbed the animal's mane. There followed, a wrangle.
  <lb/>The observant regiment, standing at rest in the road-way, whooped at once and entered whole-souled upon the side of the maiden. The men became so engrossed in this affair that they entirely ceased to remember their own large war. They jeered the piratical private and called attention to various defects in his personal appearance. And they were wildly enthusiastic in support of the young girl.
  <lb/>To her from some distance came bold advice. "Hit him with a stick."
  <lb/>There were crows and cat-calls showered upon him when he retreated without the horse. The regiment rejoiced at his downfall. Loud and vociferous congratulations were showered upon the maiden who stood panting and regarding the troops with defiance.
</ab><milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_024"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>At night-fall, the column broke into regimental pieces and the fragments went into the fields to camp. Tents sprang up like strange plants. Camp-fires, like red, peculiar blossoms, dotted the night.
  <lb/>The youth kept from intercouse with his companions as much as circumstances would allow him. In the evening, he wandered a few paces into the gloom. From this little distance, the many fires with the black forms of men passing to and fro before the crimson rays made weird and satanic effects,
  <lb/>He lay down in the grass. The blades pressed tenderly against his cheek. The moon had been lighted and was hung in a tree-top. The liquid stillness of the night, enveloping him, made him feel vast pity for himself. There was a caress in the soft winds. And the whole mood of the darkness, he thought, was one of sympathy for him in his distress.
  <lb/>He wished without reserve that he was at home again, making the endless rounds, from the house to the barn, from the barn to the fields, from the fields to the barn, from the barn to the house. He remembered he had often cursed the brindle-cow and her mates, and had sometimes flung milking-stools. But from his present point of view, there was a halo of happiness about each of their heads and he would have sacrificed all the brass buttons on the continent to have been enabled to return to them. He told himself that he was not formed for a soldier. And he mused seriously upon the radical differences between himself and those men who were dodging, imp-like,
</ab><milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_025"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>around the fires .
  <lb/>As he mused thus, he heard the rustle of grass and, upon turning his head discovered, the loud soldier. He called out. "Oh, Wilson."
  <lb/>The latter approached and looked down. "Why, hello, Henry, is it you? What yeh doin' here?"
  <lb/>"Oh--thinkin'," said the youth.
  <lb/>The other sat down and carefully lighted his pipe. "You're gittin' blue, m' boy. You're lookin' thunderin' peek-ed. What th' dickens is wrong with yeh?"
  <lb/>"Oh--nothin'," said the youth.
  <lb/>The loud soldier launched then into the subject of the anticipated fight. "Oh, we've got'em now." As he spoke his boyish face was wreathed in a gleeful smile and his voice had an exultant ring. "We've got'em now. At last by th' eternal thunders, we'll lick'em good."
  <lb/>"If th' truth was known," he added more soberly, "they've licked us about every clip up t' now, but this time--this time, we'll lick'em good."
  <lb/>"I thought yeh was objectin' t' this march a little while ago," said the youth coldly.
  <lb/>"Oh, it wasn't that," explained the other. "I don't mind marchin' if there's goin.' t' be fightin at th' end of it. What I hate is this gittin' moved here an' moved there with no good comin' of it, as far as I kin see, exceptin' sore feet an' damn' short rations."
  <lb/>"Well, Jim Conklin says we'll git a-plenty of fightin' this time."
  <lb/>"He's right fer once, I guess, 'though I can't see how it come. This time we're in for a big battle an' we've got th' best end of it certain-sure. Gee-rod, how we will thump'em."
</ab><milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_026"/>

  <lb/>He arose and began to pace to and fro excitedly. The thrill of his enthusiasm made him walk with an elastic step. He was sprightly, vigorous, fiery in his belief in success. He looked into the future with clear, proud eye. And he swore with the air of an old soldier.
  <lb/>The youth watched him for a moment in silence. When he finally spoke, his voice was as bitter as dregs. "Oh, you're gain' t' do great things, I s'pose."
  <lb/>The loud soldier blew a thoughtful cloud of smoke from his pipe. "Oh, I don't know," he remarked with dignity. "I don't know. I s'pose I'll do as well as th' rest. I'm goin' t' try like thunder." He evidently complimented himself upon the modesty of this statement.
  <lb/>"How d' yeh know yeh won't run when th' time comes?" asked the youth.
  <lb/>"Run?" said the loud one. "Run? Of course not." He laughed.
  <lb/>"Well," continued the youth, "lots of good-a-'nough men have thought they was gain' t' do great things before th' fight but when th' time come, they skedaddled."
  <lb/>"Oh, that's all true, I s'pose;" replied the other, "but I'm not gain' t' skedaddle. Th' man that bets on my runnin', will lose his money, that's all." He nodded confidently.
  <lb/>"Oh, shucks," said the youth. "Yeh aint th' bravest man in th' world, are yeh?"
  <lb/>"No, I aint," exclaimed the blatant soldier indignantly. "An' I didnt say I was th' bravest man in th' world, neither. I said I was goin' t' do my share of fightin'--that's what I said. An' I am, too. Who are you, anyhow? You talk as if yeh thought yeh was Napolyon Bonypart." He glared at the youth for a moment and then strode away.

  <lb/>Other regiments floundered up the bank.

  <lb/>A<add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_033_z016">bsurd</add> ideas took hold upon him. He <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_033_z004">that</del> thought

  <lb/>A house, standing placidly in distant fields
  <lb/>had to him an ominous look. The shadows of the
  <lb/>woods were formidable. He was certain that in this
  <lb/>vista there lurked fierce-eyed hosts. The swift thought
  <lb/>came to him that the generals did not know what they
  <lb/>were about. It was all a trap. Suddenly those close
  <lb/>forests would bristle with rifle-barrels. Iron-like

  <lb/>The youth felt the old thrill at the sight of the emblems. They were like beautiful birds strangely undaunted in a storm.
  <lb/>As he listened to the din from the hill side, to a deep, pulsating thunder that came from afar to the left, and to the lesser clamors which came from many directions, it occurred to him that they were fighting too, over there and over there and over there. Heretofore, he had supposed that all the battle was directly under his nose.
  <lb/>As he gazed around him, the youth felt a flash of astonishment at the blue pure sky and the sun-gleamings on the trees and fields. It was surprising that nature had gone tranquilly on with her golden processes in the midst of so much devilment.
</ab><milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_053"/><ab>532240<lb/>VI<lb/>FlemingThe youth awakened slowly. He came gradually back to a position from
  which he could regard himself. For moments, he had been scrutiniz-
  ing his positionperson in a dazed way as if he had never before seen
  himself. Then he picked up his cap from the ground. He wriggled
  in his jacket to make a more comfortable fit and, kneeling, re-laced
  his shoe. He thoughtfully moped his reeking features.
  <lb/>So it was all over at last. The supreme trial had been
  passed. The red, formidable difficulties of war had been vanquished.
  <lb/>He went into an ecstasy of self-satisfaction. He had the
  most delightful sensations of his life. Standing as if apart from
  himself, he viewed the last scene. He percieved that the man
  who had fought thus was magnificent.
  <lb/>He felt that he was a fine fellow. He saw himself even
  with those ideals which he had considered as far beyond him.
  He smiled within deep gratifications.
  <lb/>HeUpon his fellows, he beamed tenderness and good-will. "Gee,
  aint it hot, hay?" he said affably to a man who was polishing
  his streaming face with his coat-sleeve.
  <lb/>"You bet," said the other, grinning sociably. "I never
  seen sech dumb hotness." He sprawedsprawled out luxuriously
  on the ground. "Gee, yes! An' I hope we don't have no more
  fightin' 'til--'til a week from Monday."
  <lb/>There were some hand-shakings and deep speeches with
  men whose features only were familar but with whom Fleming now
  felt the bonds of tied hearts. He helped a cursing comrade to
  bind up a wound of the shin.
  <lb/>But, of a sudden, cries of amazement broke out along
  the ranks of the new menregiment. "Here they come a'gin!

  <lb/>The face of a youthful rider who was jerking his fran-

  <lb/>barn-yard was impressed deep upon his mind. He knew that 
  <lb/>he looked upon a man who would presently be dead.

  <lb/>He saw a brigade going to the relief of it's pestered
  <lb/>fellows. He scrambled upon a wee hill and watched it
  <lb/>sweeping finely, keeping formation in difficult places. The

  <lb/>brilliant flags projected. Officer<del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_058_z009">'</del>s were shouting.
  <lb/>This sight, also, filled him with wonder. The brigade

  <lb/>on a bounding horse made maniacal motions with his 
  <lb/>arms. The teams went swinging up from the rear, the

  <lb/>The cannon with their noses poked slantingly at the ground 
  <lb/>grunted and grumbled like stout men, brave but with objections to hurry.

  <lb/>had left the place of noises .
  <lb/>Later, he came upon a general of division seated upon a horse that 
  <lb/>pricked it's ears in an interested way at the battle. There was <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_058_z018">g</del> <add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_058_z019">a</add> great

  <lb/>The quiet man, astride, looked mouse-colored upon such a splendid charger.
  <lb/>A jingling staff was galloping hither and thither. Sometimes 
  <lb/>the general was surrounded by horsemen and at other times he was 
  <lb/>quite alone. He looked to be much harassed. He had the
</ab><milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_059"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>appearance of a business man whose market is swinging up and down.
  <lb/>The youth went slinking around this spot. He went as near as he dared trying to over-hear words. Perhaps the general, unable to comprehend chaos might call upon him for information. And he could tell him. He knew all concerning it. Of a surety the force was in a fix and any fool could see that if they did not retreat while they had opportunity--why--
  <lb/>He felt that he would like to thrash the general, or, at least, approach and tell him in plain words exactly what he thought him to be. It was criminal to stay calmly in one spot and make no effort to stay destruction. He loitered in a fever of eagerness for the division-cammander to apply to him.
  <lb/>As he warily moved about, he heard the general call out irritably. "Tompkins, go over an' see Taylor an' tell him not t' be in such all-fired hurry--tell him t' halt his brigade in th' edge of th' woods--tell him t' detach a reg'ment--say I think th' centre'll break if we don't help it out some--tell him t' hurry up."
  <lb/>A slim youth on a fine chestnut horse caught these swift words from the mouth of his superior. He made his horse bound into a gallop almost from a walk in his haste to go upon his mission. There was a cloud of dust.
  <lb/>A moment later, the youth saw the general bounce excitedly in his saddle.
  <lb/>"Yes--by Heavens--they have!" The officer leaned forward. His face was a-flame with excitement. "Yes, by Heavens, they've held'im! They've held'im."
  <lb/>He began to blithely roar at his staff.

<lb/>were the work of a master's legs.
  <lb/>Thoughts of his comrades came to him. The brittle

<lb/>it could be proven that they had been fools.
<lb/>He wondered what they would remark when later

<lb/>was trodden beneath the feet of an iron injustice. He had
<lb/>proceeded with wisdom and from the most righteous motives un-

<lb/>that the judgment of m<subst facs="#ms_062_z012"><del rend="overwrite ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_062_z012">e</del><add place="inline" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_062_z012">a</add></subst>n is thistle-down in wind.
<lb/>He went from the fields into a thicks woods as if
<lb/>resolved to bury himself. He wished to get out of hearing of the
<lb/>crackling shots which were to him like voices.
<lb/>The ground was cluttered with vines and bushes and

  <lb/>After a time, the sound of musketry

  <lb/>The youth wended, feeling that nature was of his mind. She reinforced his arguments with proofs that lived where the sun shone.
  <lb/>Once he found himself almost into a swamp. He was obliged to walk upon bog-tufts and watch his feet to keep from the oily mire. Pausing at one time to look about him, he saw out at some black water, a small animal pounce in and emerge directly with a silver-gleaming fish .
  <lb/>The youth went again into the deep thickets. The brushed branches made a noise that drowned the sounds of cannon. He walked on, going from obscurity into promises of a greater obscurity.
  <lb/>At length, he reached a place where the high, arching boughs made a chapel. He softly pushed the green doors aside and entered. Pine-needles were a gentle brown carpet. There was a religious half-light.
  <lb/>Near the threshold, he stopped horror-stricken at the sight of a thing.
  <lb/>He was being looked at by a dead man who was seated with his back against a column-like tree. The corpse was dressed in a uniform that once had been blue but was now faded to a melancholy shade of green. The eyes, staring at the youth, had changed to the dull hue to be seen on the side of a dead fish. The mouth was opened. Its red had changed to an apalling yellow. Over the grey skin of the face ran little ants. One was trundling some sort of a bundle along the upper lip.
  <lb/>The youth gave a shriek as he confronted the thing. He was, for moments, turned to stone before it. He remained staring into the liquid-looking eyes. The dead man and the living man exchanged a long look. Then, the youth cautiously put one hand behind him

  <lb/>and <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_065_z003">touched</del> brought it against a tree. Leaning upon this,

  <lb/>suggestion to touch the corpse. As he thought of his hand 
  <lb/>upon it, he shuddered profoundly.
  <lb/>At last, he burst the bounds which had fastened 
  <lb/>him to the spot and fled, unheeding the underbrush. He was 
  <lb/>pursued by a sight of the black<del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_065_z008">s</del> ants swarming <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_065_z007">greedily</add> upon the grey

  <lb/>VIII
  <lb/>The trees began softly to sing a hymn of twilight. The burnished sun sank until slanted bronze rays struck the forest. There was a lull in the noises of insects as if they had bowed their beaks and were making a devotional pause. There was silence save for the chanted chorus of the trees.
  <lb/>Then, upon this stillness, there suddenly broke a tremendous clangor of sounds. A crimson roar came from the distance.
  <lb/>The youth stopped. He was transfixed by this terrific medley of all noises. It was as if worlds were being rended. There was the ripping sound of musketry and the breaking crash of the artillery.
  <lb/>His mind flew in all directions. He concieved the two armies to be at each other panther-fashion. He listened for a time. Then he began to run in the direction of the battle. He saw that it was an ironical thing for him to be running thus toward that which he had been at such pains to avoid. But he said, in substance, to himself that if the earth and the moon were about to clash, many persons would doubtless plan to get upon roofs to witness the collision.
  <lb/>As he ran, he became aware that the forest had stopped it's music, as if at last becoming capable of hearing the foreign sounds. The trees hushed and stood motionless. Everything seemed to be listening to the crackle and clatter and ear-shaking thunder. The chorus pealed over the still earth.
  <lb/>It suddenly occurred to the youth that the fight in which he had been, was, after all, but perfunctory
</ab><milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_068"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>popping. In the hearing of this present din, he was doubtful if he had seen real battle-scenes. This uproar explained a celestial battle; it was tumbling hordes a-struggle in the air.
  <lb/>Reflecting, he saw a sort of a humor in the point of view of himself and his fellows during the late encounter. They had taken themselves and the enemy very seriously and had imagined that they were deciding the war. Individuals must have supposed that they were cutting the letters of their names deep into everlasting tablets of brass or enshrining their reputations forever in the hearts of their countrymen, while, as to fact, the affair would appear in printed reports under a meek and immaterial title. But he saw that it was good, else, he said, in battle everyone would surely run save forlorn hopes and their ilk.
  <lb/>He went rapidly on. He wished to come to the edge of the forest that he might peer out.
  <lb/>As he hastened, there passed through his mind pictures of stupendous conflicts. His accumulated thought upon such subjects were used to form scenes. The noise was as the voice of an eloquent being, describing.
  <lb/>Sometimes, the brambles formed chains and tried to hold him back. Trees, confronting him, stretched out their arms and forbade him to pass. After it's previous hostility, this new resistance of the forest filled him with a fine bitterness. It seemed that nature could not be quite ready to kill him.
  <lb/>But he obstinately took roundabout ways and presently he was where he could see long grey walls of vapor, where lay battle-lines. The voices of cannon shook him. The musketry sounded in long irregular surges that played havoc with his ears. He
</ab><milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_069"/><ab rend="top"><metamark place="margin-top" function="foliation" rend="ink" change="mStA" facs="#ms_069_z040">69</metamark></ab><ab><lb/>stood, regardant, for a moment. His eyes had an awe-

  <lb/>Presently, he proceeded again on his forward way. The 
  <lb/>battle was like the grinding of an immense and terrible ma-

  <lb/>it's grim processes, fascinated him. He must go close 
  <lb/>and see it produce corpses.
  <lb/>He came to a fence and clambered over it. On 
  <lb/>the far side, the ground was littered with clothes and guns. 
  <lb/>A newspaper, folded up, lay in the dirt. A dead sol-
  <lb/>dier was stretched with his face hidden in his arm. Fur-

  <lb/>He came finally to a road from which he could see

  <lb/>musketry was mingled red cheers. And from this region 
  <lb/>of noises came the steady current of the maimed.

  <lb/>One was marching with an air imitative of some sublime
  <lb/>drum-major. Upon his features was an unholy mixture of 
  <lb/>merriment and agony. As he marched he sang isa bit of 
  <lb/>doggerel in a high and quavering voice.
  <lb/>"Sing a song 'a vic'try"
  <lb/>"A pocketful 'a bullets"
  <lb/>"Five an' twenty dead men"
  <lb/>"Baked in a--pie."
  <lb/>Parts of the procession limped and staggered to this tune.
  <lb/>Another had the grey seal of death already upon his 
  <lb/>face. His lips were curled in hard lines and his teeth were clenched. His hands were bloody from where he had pressed 
  <lb/>them upon his wound. He seemed to be awaiting the moment 
  <lb/>when he should pitch headlong. He stalked like the <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_070_z013">grim</del> 
  <lb/>spectre of a soldier, his eyes <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_070_z013">buring</del>burning with the power of a stare 
  <lb/>into the unknown.
  <lb/>There were some who proceeded sullenly, full of anger at 
  <lb/>their wounds and ready to turn upon anything as an obscure cause.
  <lb/>An officer was carried along by two privates. He was peevish. 
  <lb/>"Don't joggle so, Johnson, yeh fool," he cried. "Think m'leg is 
  <lb/>made of iron? If yeh can't carry me decent, put me down

  <lb/>He bellowed at the tottering crowd who blocked the quick march 
  <lb/>of his bearers. "Say, make way there, can't yeh? Make way, dickens take it all."
  <lb/>They sulkily parted and went to the roadsides. As he was
  <lb/>carried <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_070_z013">it</del>past they made part remarks to him. when he raged
  <lb/>and threatened them, they told him to be damned.

  <lb/>in which the men had been entangled.
  <lb/>Orderlies and couriers occasionally broke through the
  <lb/>throng in the roadway, scattering wounded men right
  <lb/>and left, galloping on, followed by howls. The mel-
  <lb/>ancholy march was continually disturbed by the messengers
  <lb/>and sometimes by bustling batteries that came swinging and
  <lb/>thumping down upon them, the officiers shouting orders to
  <lb/>clear the way.
  <lb/>There was a tattered man, fouled with dust, blood
  <lb/>and powder-stain from hair to shoes who trudged quietly
  <lb/>at <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_071_z006">Fleming's</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_071_z005">the youth's</add> side. He was listening with eagerness and
  <lb/>much humility to the lurid descriptions of a bearded serjeant.
  <lb/>His lean features wore an expression of awe and admiration.

  <lb/>told among the <del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_071_z007">s</del>sugar-barrels. He eyed the story-teller
  <lb/>with unspeakable wonder. His mouth was a-gape in yokel fashion.
  <lb/>The serjeant, taking note of this, gave pause to his el-

  <lb/>The youth, who been holding a bitter debate with himself and casting glances of hate and contempt at the tattered man, here spoke in a hard voice. "Good-bye," he said.
  <lb/>The tattered man looked at him in gapeing amazement. "Why--why, pardner, where yeh goin'," he asked unsteadily.

"Now--now--look-a-here you Tom Jamison--now--I won't have this-this here won't do. Where--where yeh goin'?"
  <lb/>The youth pointed vaguely. "Over there," he replied.
  <lb/>"Well, now, look-a-here--now--" said the tattered man, rambling on in idiot-fashion. His head was hanging forward and his words were slurred. "This thing won't do, now, Tom Jamison.

  <lb/>In reply, the youth climbed a fence and started away. He could hear the tattered man bleating plaintively.

  <lb/>These thoughts up-lifted him. He felt the quiver of war-desire. In his ears, he heard the ring of victory. He knew the frenzy of a rapid successful charge. The music of the trampling feet, the sharp voices, the clanking arms of the column near him made him soar on the red wings of war. For a few moments, he was sublime.
  <lb/>He thought that he was about to start fleetly for the front. Indeed, he saw a picture of himself, dust-stained, haggard, panting, flying to the front at the proper moment to sieze and throttle the dark, leering witch of calamity.
  <lb/>Then the difficulties of the thing began to drag at him. He hesitated, balancing awkwardly on one foot.
  <lb/>He had no rifle; he could not fight with his hands, said he, resentfully to his plan. Well, rifles could be had for the picking. They were extraordinarily profuse.
  <lb/>Also, he continued, it would be a miracle if he found his regiment. Well, he could fight with any regiment.
  <lb/>He started forward slowly. He stepped as if he expected to tread upon some explosive thing. Doubts and he were struggling.
  <lb/>He would truly be a worm if any of his comrades should see him returning thus, the marks of his flight upon him. There was a reply that the intent fighters did not care for what happened rear-word saving that no hostile bayonets appeared there. In the battle-blur his face would, in a way, be hidden like the face of a cowled man.
  <lb/>But then, he said, that his tireless fate would bring forth, when the strife lulled for a moment, a man to ask of him an explantion. In imagination he felt the scrutiny of his companions as he painfully labored through some lies.

  <lb/>the sore badge of his dishonor through life. With his heart

  <lb/>exist without making it, through his actions, apparent to all men .
  <lb/>If the army had gone gloriously on, he would be<del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_095_z010">indeed</del>

  <lb/>successful life.
  <lb/>As these thoughts went rapidly through his mind, he turned
  <lb/>upon them and tried to thrust them away. He denounced him-
  <lb/>self as a villain. He said that he was the most unutterably
  <lb/>selfish man in existence. His mind pictured the soldiers who

  <lb/>bitterly that their crowns were stolen and their robes of glorious
  <lb/>memories were shams. However, he still said that it was a
  <lb/>great pity he was not as they.
  <lb/>A defeat of the army had suggested itself to him as a
  <lb/>means of escape from the consequences of his fall. He con-
  <lb/>sidered<add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_096_z009">,</add><del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_096_z001">, however, </del> now, however, that it was useless to think of

  <lb/>success for that mighty blue machine was certain; that it
  <lb/>would make victories as a contrivance turns out buttons.
  <lb/>He presently discard ed all his speculations in the other dir-
  <lb/>ection. He returned to the creed of soldiers.
  <lb/>When he percieved again that it was not possible
  <lb/>for the army to be defeated, he tried to be-think him of a
  <lb/>fine tale which he could take back to his regiment and
  <lb/>with it turn the expected shafts of derision .
  <lb/>But, as he mortally feared these shafts, it became impossible
  <lb/>for him to invent a tale which he felt he could trust. He experi-
  <lb/>mented with many schemes but threw them aside one by one as flimsy.
  <lb/>He was quick to see vulnerable places in them all.
  <lb/>Furthermore, he was much afraid that some
  <lb/>arrow of scorn might lay him mentally low before
  <lb/>he could raise his protecting tale.
  <lb/>He run, didn't'e? Oh, my!" He recalled various persons
  <lb/>who would be quite sure to leave him no peace about it.
  <lb/>They would doubtless question him with sneers and
</ab><milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_097"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>laugh at his stammering hesitation. In the next engagement they would try to keep watch of him to discover when he would run.
  <lb/>Wherever he went in camp, he would encounter insolent and lingeringly-cruel stares. As he imagined himself passing near a crowd of comrades, he could hear some one say: "There he goes!"
  <lb/>Then, as if the heads were moved by one muscle, all the faces were turned toward him with wide, derisive grins. He seemed to hear some one make a humorous remark in a low tone. At it, the others all crowed and cackled. He was a slang-phrase.

  and galling outrages. Minds, he said, were not made all with one
  stamp and colored green. He was of no general pattern. It was
  not right to measure his acts by a world-wide standard. The
  laws of the <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#dc_98-0016">wron</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#dc_98_z017">world</add> were wrong because through the vain

  size and of a green color. There was no justice on the
  earth when justice was meant. Men were too puny and prat-
  tling to know anything of it. If there was a justice, it must be
  in the hands of a God.
  <lb/>He regarded his sufferings as <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#dc_98_z013">peculiar and</del>unprecedented.
  No man had ever achieved such misery. There was a melan-
  choly grandeur in the isolation of his experiences. He saw that
  he was a speck raising his minute arms against all possible forces
  and fates which were swelling down upon him in black tem-
  pests. He could derive some consolation from viewing the <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#dc_98_z018">sub</del>
  sublimity of the odds.
  <lb/>As he went on, he began to feel that nature, for her part,
  would not blame him for his rebellion. He still distinctly felt that
  he was arrayed against the universe but he <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#dc_98_z019">began to believe</del>believed now that
  there was no malice in the vast breasts of his space-filling foes.
  It was merely law, not merciful to the individual; but just, to
  a system. Nature had provided the creations with various
  defenses and ways of escape that they might fight or flee,
  and she had limited dangers in powers of attack and pursuit
  that the things might resist or <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#dc_98-0020">flee</del>hide with a <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#dc_98_z021">strength</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#dc_98_z022">security</add>

  <lb/>cruel but it was war. Nature fought for her system; individuals fought for liberty to breathe. The animals had the privilege of using their legs and their brains. It was all the same old philosophy. He could not omit a small grunt of satisfaction as he saw with what brilliancy he had reasoned it out.
  <lb/>He now said that, if, as he supposed, his life was being relentlessly pursued, it was not his duty to bow to the approaching death. Nature did not expect submission. On the contrary, it was his business to kick and bite and give blows as a stripling in the hands of a murderer. The law was that he should fight. He would be saved according to the importance of his strength .
  <lb/>His egotism made him feel safe, for a time, from the iron hands.
  <lb/>It being in his mind that he had solved these matters, he eagerly applied his findings to the incident of his flight from the battle. It was not a fault, a shameful thing; it was an act obedient to a law. It was--
  <lb/>But he was aware that when he had erected a vindicating structure of great principles, it was the calm toes of tradition that kicked it all down about his ears. He immediately antagonized then this devotion to the by-gone; this universal adoration of the past. From the bitter pinnacle of his wisdom he saw that mankind not only worshipped the gods of the ashes but that the gods of the ashes were worshipped because they were the gods of the ashes. He percieved with anger the present state of affairs in it's bearing upon his case. And he resolved to reform it all.
  <lb/>He had, presently, a feeling that he was the growing prophet of a world-reconstruction. Far down in the untouched depths of his being, among the hidden currents of his soul, he saw born a voice. He concieved a new world modelled by the pain of his life, and in which no old shadows fell blighting upon the temple of thought. And there were many personal advantages in it.

  <lb/>words had been said from star to star. An event had been penned by the implacable forces.
  <lb/>He was of the unfit, then. He did not come into the scheme of further life. His tiny part had been done and he must go. There was no room for him. On all the vast lands there was not a foot-hold. He must be thrust out to make room for the more important.
  <lb/>Regarding himself as one of the unfit, he believed that nothing could exceed for misery, a perception of this fact. He thought that he measured with his falling heart, tossed in like a pebble by his supreme and awful foe, the most profound depths of pain. It was a barbarous process with affection for the man and the oak, and no sympathy for the rabbit and the weed. He thought of his own capacity for pity and there was an infinite irony in it.
  <lb/>He desired to revenge himself upon the universe. Feeling in his body all spears of pain, he would have capsized, if possible, the world and made chaos. Much cruelty lay in the fact that he was a babe.
  <lb/>Admitting that he was powerless and at the will of law, he yet planned to escape; menaced by fatality he schemed to avoid it. He thought of various places in the world where he imagined that he would be safe. He remembered hiding once in an empty flour-barrel that sat in his mother's pantry. His playmates, hunting the bandit-chief, had thundered on the barrel with their fierce sticks but he had lain snug and undetected. They had searched the house.

  out of the woods and down through the fields. He knew at once that
  the steel fibres had been washed from their hearts. They were bursting
  from their coats and their equipments as from entanglements. They
  charged down upon him like terrified buffaloes.
  <lb/>Behind them, blue smoke curled and clouded <restore change="mStA" hand="#SC" facs="#ms_098-104_z030">o</restore>above the tree-tops

  <lb/>Suddenly his legs seemed to die. He sank writheing to the

<lb/>pain he was like a man wrestling with a creature of the air.
  <lb/>There was a sinister struggle.
  <lb/>Sometimes, he would achieve a position half-erect, battle with

<lb/>grabbing at the grass. His face was of a clammy pallor. Deep
<lb/>groans were wrenched from him .
  <lb/>At last, with a twisting movement, he got upon his hands

<lb/>the grass.
  <lb/>He fought an intense battle with his body. His dulled
<lb/>senses wished him to swoon and he opposed them stubbornly, his

<lb/>He imagined secluded spots where he could fall and be un

  <lb/>Once, he put his hand to the top of his head and timidly

<lb/>were dabbled with blood. He regarded them with a fixed stare.
  <lb/>Around him, he could hear the grumble of jolt<add place="margin-right" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_106_z033">ed</add>
<lb/>cannon <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_106_z039">batteries</del> as the scurrving horses were lashed toward

  <lb/>curve toward a gap in a fence. The officer was making 
  <lb/>excited motions with a gauntleted hand. The guns followed
  <lb/>the teams with an air of unwillingness <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_107_z001">.</del> of being dragged by the heels.
  <lb/>Some officers of the scattered infantry were cursing and 
  <lb/>railing like fish-wives. Their scolding voices could be heard 
  <lb/>above the din. Into the unspeakable <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_107_z001">jumble</add> in the road-way, rode a 
  <lb/>squadron of cavalry. The faded yellow of their facings 
  <lb/>shone bravely. There was a mighty altercation.
  <lb/>The artillery were assembling as if for a conference.
  <lb/>The blue haze of evening was upon the fields. The lines 
  <lb/>of forest were long purple shadows. One cloud lay along the west<add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_107_z004">-</add>
  <lb/>ern sky partly smothering the red.
  <lb/>As <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_107_z021"/>the youth left the scene behind him, he heard the guns sud<add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_107_z006">-</add>
  <lb/>denly roar out. He imagined them shaking in black rage. They 
  <lb/>belched and roared like brass devils guarding a gate. The 
  <lb/>soft air was filled with the tremendous remonstrance. With 
  <lb/>it came the shattering peal of opposing infantry. Turning to
  <lb/>look behind him, he could see sheets of orange light illu-<add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_107_z007"/>
  <lb/>mine the shadowy distance. There were subtle and sudden 
  <lb/>lightnings in the far air. At times, he thought he could 
  <lb/>see heaving masses of men.
  <lb/>He hurried on in the dusk. The day had faded until 
  <lb/>he could barely distinguish place for his feet. The purple dark-<add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_107_z010"/>

  <lb/>times, he could see them gesticulating against the blue, 
  <lb/>and sombre sky. There seemed to be a great ruck of men
  <lb/>and munitions spread about in the forest and in the 
  <lb/>fields. The little narrow road-way now lay <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_107_z025">like</del> lifeless. <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_107_z017">torrent</del> There were over-turned wagons like sun-dried

</ab><milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_108"/>  <lb/>It had come to pass that his wound pained him but
  <lb/>little. He was afraid to move rapidly, however, for a 
  <lb/>dread of disturbing it. He held his head very still and
  <lb/>took many precautions against stumbling. He was filled 
  <lb/>with anxiety and his face was pinched and drawn in 
  <lb/>anticipation of the pain of any sudden mistake of his
  <lb/>feet in the gloom.
  <lb/>His thoughts, as he walked, fixed intently upon his
  <lb/>hurt. There was a cool, liquid feeling about it and he 
  <lb/>imagined blood moving slowly down under his hair. His head
  <lb/>seemed swollen to a size that made <del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_108_z001">his neck</del> him think
  <lb/>his neck to be inadequate.
  <lb/>The new silence of his wound made much worri-
  <lb/>ment. The little, blistering voices of pain that had called 
  <lb/>out from his scalp, were, he thought, definite in their
  <lb/>expression of danger. By them, he believed that he could
  <lb/>measure his plight. But when they remained ominously
  <lb/>silent, he became frightened and imagined terrible fing-
  <lb/>ers that clutched into his brain.
  <lb/>Amidst it, he began to reflect upon various incidents and
  <lb/>conditions of the past. He bethought him of certain meals his 
  <lb/>mother had cooked at home, in which those dishes of which
  <lb/>he was particularly fond had occupied prominent positions.
  <lb/>He saw the spread table. The pine walls of the kitchen 
  <lb/>were glowing in the warm light from the stove. Too, he re-
  <lb/>membered how he and his companions used to go from the
  <lb/>schoolhouse to the bank of a shaded pool. He saw his
  <lb/>clothes in disorderly array upon the grass of the bank. He 
  <lb/>felt the swash of the fragrant water upon his body. 
  <lb/>The leaves ot the over-hanging maple rustled with mel-
  <lb/>ody in the wind of youthful summer.

  <lb/>we didnt lose but a few. They'd been scattered all over, wanderin' around in th' woods, fightin with other reg'ments an' everything. Jest like you done."
  <lb/>"So?" said the youth.
  <lb/>He went into a brown mood. He thought with deep contempt of all his grapplings and tuggings with fate and the universe. It now was evident that a large proportion of the men of the regiment had been, if they chose, capable of the same quantity of condemnation of the world and could as righteously have taken arms against everything. He laughed.
  <lb/>He now rejoiced in a view of what he took to be the universal resemblance. He decided that he was not, as he had supposed, a unique man. There were many in his type. And he had believed that he was suffering new agonies and feeling new wrongs. On the contrary, they were old, all of them, they were born perhaps with the first life.
  <lb/>These thoughts took the element of grandeur from his experiences. Since many had had them there could be nothing fine about them. They were now ridiculous.
  <lb/>However, he yet considered himself to be below the standard of traditional man-hood. He felt abashed when confronting memories of some men he had seen.
  <lb/>These thoughts did not appear in his attitude. He now considered the fact of his having fled, as being buried. He was returned to his comrades and unimpeached. So despite the little shadow of his sin upon his mind, he felt his self-respect growing strong within him. His pride had almost recovered it's balance and was about

  <lb/>The regiment was standing at order-arms at the side of a lane, waiting for the cammand to march when suddenly the youth remembered the little packet enwrapped in a faded yellow envelope which the loud young soldier with lugubrious words had entrusted to him. It made him start. He uttered an exclamation and turned toward his comrade.
  <lb/>"Wilson!"
  <lb/>"What?"
  <lb/>His friend, at his side in the ranks, was thoughtfully staring down the road. From some cause, his expression was at that moment, very meek. The youth, regarding him with sidelong glances, felt impelled to change his purpose. "Oh, nothin'," he said.
  <lb/>His friend turned his head in some surprise. "Why, what was yeh gain' t' say." "Oh, nothin'," repeated the youth.
  <lb/>He resolved not to deal the little blow. It was sufficient that the fact made him glad. It was not necessary to knock his friend on the head with the misguided packet.
  <lb/>He had been possessed of much fear of his friend for he saw how easily questionings could make holes in his feelings. Lately, he had assured himself that the altered comrade would not tantalize him with a persistent curiosity but he felt certain that during the first period of leisure his friend would ask him to relate his adventures of the previous day.

  <lb/>In the present, he declared to himself that it was only the doomed and the damned who roared with sincerity at nature. Few, but they, ever did it. A man with a full stomach and the respect of his fellows had no business to scold about anything that he might think to be wrong in the ways of the universe, or, even with the ways of society. Let the unfortunates rail; the others may play marbles.
  <lb/>Since he was comfortable and contented, he had no desire to set things straight. Indeed, he no more contended that they were not
  <lb/>straight. How could they be crooked when he was restored to a requisite amount of happiness. There was a slowly developeing conviction that in all his red speeches he had been ridiculously mistaken. Nature was a fine thing moving with a magnificent justice. The world was fair and wide and glorious. The sky was kind, and smiled tenderly, full of encouragement, upon him.
  <lb/>Some poets now recieved his scorn. Yesterday, in his misery, he had thought of certain persons who had written. Their remembered words, broken and detached, had come piece-meal to him. For these people he had then felt a glowing, brotherly regard. They had wandered in paths of pain and they had made pictures of the black landscape that others might enjoy it with them. He had, at that time, been sure that their wise, contemplating spirits had been in sympathy with him, had shed tears from the clouds. He had walked alone, but there had been pity, made before a reason for it.
  <lb/>But he was now, in a measure, a successful
</ab><milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_130"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>man and he could no longer tolerate in himself a spirit of fellowship for poets. He abandoned them. Their songs about black landscapes were of no importance to him since his new eyes said that his landscape was not black. People who called landscapes black were idiots.
  <lb/>He achieved a mighty scorn for such a snivelling race.
  <lb/>He felt that he was the child of the powers. Through the peace of his heart, he saw the earth to be a garden in which grew no weeds of agony. Or, perhaps, if there did grow a few, it was in obscure corners where no one was obliged to encounter them unless a ridiculous search was made. And, at any rate, they were tiny ones.
  <lb/>He returned to his old belief in the ultimate, astonishing success of his life. He, as usual, did not trouble about processes. It was ordained, because he was a fine creation. He saw plainly that he was the chosen of some gods. By fearful and wonderful roads he was to be led to a crown. He was, of course, satisfied that he deserved it.
  <lb/>He did not give a great deal of thought to these battles that lay directly before him. It was not essential that he should plan his ways in regard to them. He been taught that many obligations of a life were easily avoided. The lessons of yesterday had been that retribution was a laggard and blind. With these facts before him he did not deem it necessary that he should become feverish over the possibilities of the ensuing twenty-four hours. He could leave much to chance.

  <lb/>There was a little flower of confidence growing

  <lb/>he assured himself that they were not so hideous 
  <lb/>as he had imagined them. Also, they were inac-

  <lb/>At this sight, the youth forgot many personal matters and became greatly enraged. He exploded in loud sentence. "B'jiminy, we're generaled by a lot 'a lunkheads."
  <lb/>"More than one feller has said that t'-day," observed a' man.
  <lb/>His friend, recently aroused, was still very drowsy. He looked behind him until his mind took in the meaning of the movement. Then he sighed. "Oh, well, I s'pose we got licked," he remarked, sadly.
  <lb/>The youth had a thought that it would not be handsome for him to freely condemn other men. He made an attempt to restrain himself but the words upon his tongue were too bitter. He presently began a long and intricate denunciation of the cammander of the forces.
  <lb/>"Mebbe, it w'a'nt all his fault--not all together. He did th' best he knowed. It's our luck t' git licked often," said his friend in a weary tone. He was trudging along with stooped shoulders and shifting eyes like a man who has been caned and kicked.
  <lb/>"Well, don't we fight like th' devil? Don't we do all that men kin?" demanded the youth loudly.
  <lb/>He was secretly dumb-founded at this sentiment when it came from his lips. For a moment his face lost it's valor and he looked guiltily about him. But no one questioned his right to deal in such words, and, presently, he recovered his air of courage. He went on to repeat a statement he had heard going from group to group at the camp that morning. "Th' brigadier sed he never see a new reg'ment fight th' way we fit yestirday, didnt he? An' we didn't no better than many another reg'ment, did we? Well, then, yeh can't say it's th' army's fault, kin yeh?"
</ab><milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_136"/><ab><lb/>In his reply, Wilson'sthe friend's voice was stern. "'A course not," he 
  <lb/>said,. "No man dare say we don't fight like th' devil. No man
  <lb/>will ever dare say it. Th' boys fight like devilhell-roosters.
  <lb/>But still-still, we don't have no luck."
  <lb/>"Well, then, if we fight like theth' devil an' don't ever
  <lb/>hawhip, it must be th' general'general's fault," said Flemingthe youth
  <lb/>grandly and decisively. "AndAn' I don't see noany sense in

  <lb/>A sarcastic man who was tramping at Fleming'sthe youth's
  <lb/>side, then spoke lazily. "Mebbe yeh think yeh fit th' hull
  <lb/>battle yestirday, FlemingFlemin'," he remarked.
  <lb/>The speech pierced the youth.
  <lb/>He was reduced toInward, he was reduced to abjectionsan abject pulp by these
  <lb/>chance words. His legs quaked privately. He cast a frigh-
  <lb/>tened glance at the sarcastic man.
  <lb/>"Why, no," he hastened to say in a conciliatory voice,
  <lb/>"I don't think I foughtfit theth' hullwhole battle yestirday."
  <lb/>But the other seemed innocent of any deeper mean-
  <lb/>ing. Apparently, he had no information.
  <lb/>"Oh", he said as if relieved, "I thought maybe you did."It was merely his habit.
  <lb/>"Oh," he merelyreplied in the same tone of calm derision.
  <lb/>FlemingThe youth, nevertheless, felt a threat. His mind shrank
  <lb/>from going near to the danger and, thereafter, he was silent.
  <lb/>The significance of the sarcastic man's words took from
  <lb/>him all moodsloud moods that mightwould make him appear prom-
  <lb/>inent. He became suddenly a modest man.

  <lb/>turned their faces quickly toward him and frowned with vague displeasure.
  <lb/>The noise of firing dogged their foot-steps. Sometimes, it seemed to be driven a little way but it always returned again with increased insolence. The men muttered and cursed, throwing black looks in it's direction.
  <lb/>In a clearer space, the troops were at last halted. Regiments and brigades, broken and detached through their encounters with thickets, grew together again and lines were faced toward the pursuing bark of the enemy's infantry.
  <lb/>This noise, following like the yelpings of eager, metallic hounds increased to a loud and joyous burst, and then, as the sun went serenely up the sky, throwing illuminating rays into the gloomy thickets, it broke forth into prolonged pealings. The woods began to crackle as if a-fire.
  <lb/>"Whoop-a-dadee," said a man, "here we are. Everybody fightin'. Blood an' destruction."
  <lb/>"I was willin t' bet they'd attack as soon as th' sun got fairly up," savagely asserted the lieutenant who cammanded the youth's company. He jerked without mercy at his little moustache. He strode to and fro with dark dignity in the rear of his men who were lieing down behind whatever protection they had collected.
  <lb/>A battery had trundled into position in the rear and was thoughtfull v shelling the distance. The regiment, unmolested as yet, awaited the moment when the grey shadows of the woods before them should be slashed by the lines of flame. There was much growling and swearing.

  <lb/>give him no rest, to give him no time to sit down and think. Yesterday, he had fought and had fled rapidly. There many<add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z019">had been</add> 
  <lb/><del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z020">many</del> adventures. For to-day he felt that he had earned op

  <lb/>portraying to unitiated <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z021">spe</del>listeners various scenes at which he
  <lb/>had been a witness, or, <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z022">t</del>ably discussing the processes of

  <lb/>should <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z023">have</add> time for physical recuperation. He was sore and stiff

  <lb/>were fighting with their old speed. He had a wild hate for the <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z027">rl</del>relentless foe. Yesterday, when he had imagined the un
  <lb/>iverse to be against him, he had hated it, little gods and big 
  <lb/>gods; to-day he hated the army of the foe with the same great hatred. He was not going to be badgered of his life like a

  <lb/>The youth cried out savagely at this statement. He crouched be
  <lb/>hind a little tree, with his eyes burning balefully and his teeth
  <lb/>set in a cur-like snarl. The awkward bandage was still about 
  <lb/>his head and, upon it, over his wound there was a spot of dry
  <lb/>blood. His hair was wondrously towsled and some strag
  <lb/>gling, moving locks hung over the cloth of the bandage down 
  <lb/>toward his forehead. His jacket and shirt were open at the neck
  <lb/>and exposed his young, bronzed neck. There could be seen
  <lb/>spasmodic gulpings at his throat.
  <lb/>His fingers twined nervously about his rifle. He wished
  <lb/>that it was an engine of annihilating power. He felt that he and his 
  <lb/>companions were being taunted and derided from sincere convictions
  <lb/>that they were poor and puny. 
  <lb/>His knowledge of his inability to take vengeance for it made his
  <lb/>rage into a dark and stormy spectre that possessed him and
  <lb/>made him dream of abominable cruelties. The tormentors were 
  <lb/>flies sucking insolently at his blood and he thought that he
  <lb/>would have given his life for a revenge of seeing their faces
  <lb/>in pitiful plights.
  <lb/>The winds of battle had swept all about the regiment
  <lb/>until the one rifle, instantly followed by brothers, flashed in
  <lb/>it's front. A moment later, the regiment roared forth it's sud
  <lb/>den and valiant retort. A dense wall of smoke settled slowly 
  <lb/>down. It was furiously slit and slashed by the knife-
  <lb/>like fire from the rifles.
  <lb/>To the youth, the fighters were like animals tossed for
  <lb/>a death-struggle into a dark pit. There was a sen
  <lb/>sation that he and fellows, at bay, were pushing back, always
  <lb/>pushing fierce onslaughts of creatures who were slippery.
  <lb/>Their beams of crimson seemed to get no purchase upon the
  <lb/>bodies of their foes; the latter seemed to evade them with 
  <lb/>ease and come through, between, around and about, with 
  <lb/>unopposed skill.
</ab><milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_142"/>

  <lb/>When, in a dream, it occurred to the youth that his rifle was an impotent stick, he lost sense of everything but his hate, his desire to smash into pulp the glittering smile of victory which he could feel upon the faces of his enemies.
  <lb/>The blue, smoke-swallowed line curled and writhed like a snake, stepped upon. It swung it's ends to and fro in an agony of fear and rage.
  <lb/>The youth was not conscious that he was erect upon his feet. He did not know the direction of the ground. Indeed, once he even lost the habit of balance and fell heavily. He was up again immediately. One thought went through the chaos of his brain at the time. He wondered if he had fallen because he had been shot. But the suspicion flew away at once. He did not think more of it.
  <lb/>He had taken up a first position behind the little tree with a direct determination to hold it against the world. He had not deemed it possible that his army could that day succeed and, from this, he felt the ability to fight harder. But the throng had surged in all ways until he lost directions and locations, save that he knew where lay the enemy.
  <lb/>The flames bit him and the hot smoke broiled his skin. His rifle-barrel grew so hot that, ordinarily, he could not have born it upon his palms but he kept on stuffing cartridges into it and pounding them with his clanking, bending ram-rod. If he aimed at some changing form through the smoke, he pulled his trigger with a fierce grunt as if he were dealing a blow of the fist with all his strength.
  <lb/>When the enemy seemed falling back before him and his fellows, he went instantly forward, like a dog who seeing his foes lagging, turns and insists upon being pursued. And when he was compelled to retire again, he did it slowly, sullenly, taking steps of wrathful despair.
</ab><milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_143"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>Once, he, in his intent hate, was almost alone and was firing when all those near him had ceased. He was so engrossed in his occupation that he was not aware of a lull.
  <lb/>He was re-called by a hoarse laugh and a sentence that came to his ears in a voice of contempt and amazement. "Yeh infernal fool, don't yeh know enough t' quit when there aint anything t' shoot at? Good Gawd!"
  <lb/>He turned then and pausing with his rifle thrown half into position, looked at the blue line of his comrades. During this moment of leisure, they seemed all to be engaged in staring with astonishment at him. They had become spectators. Turning to the front again, he saw, under the lifted smoke, a deserted ground.
  <lb/>He looked, bewildered, for a moment. Then there appeared upon the glazed vacancy of his eyes, a diamond-point of intelligence. "Oh," he said, comprehending.
  <lb/>He returned to his comrades and threw himself upon the ground. He sprawled like a man who has been thrashed. His flesh seemed strangely on fire and the sounds of the battle continued in his ears. He groped blindly for his canteen.
  <lb/>The lieutenant was crowing. He seemed drunk with fighting. He called out to the youth. "By heavens, if I had ten thousand wild-cats like you, I could tear th' stomach outa this war in less'n a week." He puffed out his chest with large dignity as he said it.
  <lb/>Some of the men muttered and looked at the youth in awe-struck ways. It was plain that as he had gone on loading and firing and cursing without the proper intermission, they had found time to regard him. And they now looked upon him as a war-devil.

  <lb/>The ragged line had respite for some minutes but during it's pause, the struggle in the forest became magnified until the trees seemed to quiver from the firing and the ground to shake from the rushings of the men. The voices of the cannon were mingled in a long and interminable row. It seemed difficult to live in such an atmosphere. The chests of the men strained for a bit of freshness and their throats craved water.
  <lb/>There was one, shot through the body, who raised a cry of bitter lamentation when came this lull. Perhaps, he had been calling out during the fighting also but at that time no one had heard him. But now the men turned at the woful complaints of him upon the ground.
  <lb/>"Who is it? Who is it?"
  <lb/>"It's Jimmie Rogers! Jimmie Rogers."
  <lb/>When their eyes first encountered him there was a sudden halt as if they feared to go near. He was thrashing about in the grass, twisting his shuddering body into many strange postures. He was screaming loudly. This instant's hesitation seemed to fill him with a tremendous, fantastic contempt and he damned them in shreiked sentences.
  <lb/>The youth's friend had a geographical illusion concerning a stream and he obtained permission to go for some water. Immediately, canteens were showered upon him. "Fill mine, will yeh?" "Bring me some, too." "And me, too." He departed, ladened. The youth went with his friend, feeling a desire to throw his heated body into the stream and, soaking there, drink quarts.
  <lb/>They made a hurried search for the supposed stream but did not find it. "No water here," said the youth. They turned without delay and began to retrace their steps.
</ab><milestone n="19" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_147"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>From their position as they again faced toward the place of the fighting, they could, of course, comprehend a greater amount of the battle than when their visions had been blurred by the hurlying smoke of the line. They could see dark stretches winding along the land and on one cleared space there was a row of guns making grey clouds which were filled with large flashes of orange-colored flame. Over some foliage they could see the roof of a house. One window, glowing a deep, murder-red, shone squarely through the leaves. From the edifice, a tall, leaning tower of smoke went far into the sky.
  <lb/>Looking over their own troops, they saw mixed masses slowly getting into regular form. The sun-light made twinkling points of the bright steel. To the rear, there was a glimpse of a distant road-way as it curved over a slope. It was crowded with retreating infantry. From all the interwoven forest arose the smoke and bluster of the battle. The air was always occupied by a blaring.
  <lb/>Near where they stood, shells were flip-flopping and hooting. Occasional bullets buzzed in the air and spanged into tree-trunks. Wounded men and other stragglers were slinking through the woods.
  <lb/>Looking down an aisle of the grove, Fleming and his companion saw a jangling general and his staff almost ride upon a wounded man who was crawling on his hands and knees. The general reined strongly at his charger's opened and foamy mouth and guided it with dexterous horsemanship past the man. The latter scrambled in wild and torturing haste. His strength evidently failed him as he reached a place of safety. One of his arms suddenly weakened, and he fell, slideing over upon his back. He lay stretched out, breatheing gently.
  <lb/>A moment later, the small, creaking cavalcade was directly in front of the two soldiers. Another officer, riding with the skilful abandon of a cow-boy, galloped his horse to a position directly before the general. The two unnoticed

  <lb/>the desire to over-hear the conversation. Perhaps, they thought,

  <lb/>The other <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_148_z007">off</del>swore at his restive horse and then cleared his

  <lb/>"I <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_148_z008">think</del>presume so," remarked the general. Then he began

  <lb/>They caught sight of two mounted figures a short distance 
  <lb/>from them. One was the colonel of the regiment and the other 
  <lb/>was the officer who had recieved orders from the cammander of 
  <lb/>the division. They were gesticulating at each other. Wilson

  <lb/>accepted the matter. And they mused upon it, with a if hun-
  <lb/>dred varieties of expression. It was an interesting engrossing 
  <lb/>thingd to think about. Many tightened their belts carefully
  <lb/>and hitched at their trousers.
  <lb/>A moment later, the officers began to bustle among the
  <lb/>men, pushing them into a more compact mass and into a
  <lb/>better alignment. They chased those that straggled and fumed at a 
  <lb/>few men who did seemed to show by their attitudes, that they had decided to re-
  <lb/>main at that spot. They were like critical sheperds strug-
  <lb/>gling with sheep.
  <lb/>Presently, the regiment seemed to draw itself up and heave
  <lb/>a deep breath. None of the men's faces were mirrors of large
  <lb/>thoughts. The soldiers were bended and stooped like sprinters
  <lb/>before a signal. Many pairs of glinting eyes peered from the
  <lb/>grimey faces toward the curtains of the deeper woods. They
  <lb/>seemed to be engaged in deep calculations of time and distance.
  <lb/>They were surrounded by the noises of the monstrous
  <lb/>altercation of between between the two armies. The world was fully inter-
  <lb/>ested in other matters. Apparently, the regiment had it's 
  <lb/>small affair to itself.
  <lb/>Fleming The youth, turning, shot a quick, enquiring glance til at 
  <lb/>Wilson his friend. The latter returned to him the same manner of
  <lb/>look. They were the only ones who possessed an inner know-
  <lb/>ledge. "Mule-drive'rs--hell t' pay--don't believe many 
  <lb/>will get back." It was an ironical secret. Still, they saw
  <lb/>no hesitation in each other's faces and they nodded a
  <lb/>mute and unprotesting assent when a shaggy man
  <lb/>near them said in a meek voice: "We'll git swallered."

  <lb/>He fixed his eye upon a distant and prominent clump of

  <lb/>and inflamed features surmounted by the dingy rag with it's
  <lb/>spot of blood, his wildly swinging rifle and banging ac-
  <lb/>coutrements, he looked to be an insane soldier.
  <lb/>As the regiment swung from it's position out into a
  <lb/>cleared space, the woods and thickets before it, awakened. Yellow
  <lb/>flames <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_151_z023">sl</del>leaped toward it from <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_151_z022">eve</del>many directions. The forest made a tremendous objection.
  <lb/>The line lurched straight for a moment. Then the right
  <lb/>wing swung forward; it in turn was surpassed by the left.
  <lb/>Afterward the centre careered to the front until the regiment
  <lb/>was a wedge-shaped mass but an instant later, the oppos-
  <lb/>ition of the bushes, trees and uneven places on the ground
</ab><milestone n="20" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_152"/><ab>split the cammand and scattered it into detached clusters.
  <lb/>The youth, light-footed was unconsciously in advance. His 
  <lb/>eyes still kept note of the clump of trees. From all places near 
  <lb/>it the clannish yell of the enemy could be heard. The little 
  <lb/>flames of rifles leaped from it. The song of the bullets was 
  <lb/>in the air and shells snarled among the tree-tops. One tum-
  <lb/>bled directly into the middle of a hurrying group and ex-
  <lb/>ploded in crimson fury. There was an instant's spectacle of 
  <lb/>a man, almost over it, throwing up his hands to shield his eyes.
  <lb/>Other men, punched by bullets, fell in grotesque agonies. 
  <lb/>The regiment left a coherent trail of bodies.
  <lb/>They had passed into a clearer atmosphere. There was 
  <lb/>an effect like a revelation in the new appearance of the 
  <lb/>landscape. Some men working madly at a battery were 
  <lb/>plain to them and the opposing infantry's lines were de-
  <lb/>fined by the grey walls and fringes of smoke.
  <lb/>It seemed to the youth that he saw everything. Each 
  <lb/>blade of the green grass was bold and clear. He thought that 
  <lb/>he was aware of every change in the thin, transparent va-
  <lb/>por that floated idly m sheets. The brown or grey 
  <lb/>trunks of the trees showed each roughness of their surfaces. 
  <lb/>And the men of the regiment, with their starting eyes and 
  <lb/>sweating faces, running madly, or falling, as if thrown 
  <lb/>headlong, to queer, heaped up corpses, all were comprehended. 
  <lb/>His mind took a mechanical but firm impressions, so that, after-
  <lb/>ward, everything was pictured and explained to him, save 
  <lb/>why he himself was there.
  <lb/>But there was a frenzy made from this furious rush. 
  <lb/>The men, pitching forward insanely, had burst into cheer-
  <lb/>ings, mob-like and barbaric, but tuned in strange 
  <lb/>keys that can arouse the dullard and the stoic. It made 
  <lb/>a mad enthusiasm that, it seemed, would be incapable of
</ab><milestone n="20" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_153"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>checking itself before granite and brass. There was the delirium that encounters despair and death, and is heedless and blind to the odds. It is a temporary but sublime absence of selfishness. And because it was of this order was the reason, perhaps, why Fleming wondered, afterward, what reasons he could have had for being there.
  <lb/>Presently the straining pace ate up the energies of the men. As if by agreement, the leaders began to slacken their speed. The volleys directed against them had had a seeming wind-like effect. The regiment snorted and blew. Among some stolid trees it began to falter and hesitate. The men, staring intently, began to wait for some of the distant walls of smoke to move and disclose to them the scene. Since much of their strength and their breath had vanished, they returned to caution. They were become men again.
  <lb/>The youth had a vague belief that he had run miles and he thought, in a way, that he was now in some new and unknown land.
  <lb/>The moment the regiment ceased it's advance, the protesting splutter of musketry became a steadied roar. Long and accurate fringes of smoke spread out. From the top of a small hill, came level belchings of yellow flame that caused an inhuman whistling in the air.
  <lb/>The men, halted, had opportunity to see some of their comrades dropping with moans and shrieks. A few lay under foot, still or wailing. And now for an instant the men stood, their rifles slack in their hands, and watched the regiment dwindle. They appeared dazed and stupid. This spectacle seemed to paralyze them, over-come them with a fatal fascination. They stared woodenly at the sights and, lowering their eyes, looked from face to face. It was a strange pause and a strange silence.
</ab><milestone n="20" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_154"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>Then above the sounds of the outside commotion, arose the roar of the lieutenant. His strode suddenly forth, his infantile features black with rage.
  <lb/>"Come on, yeh fools," he bellowed. "Come on! Yeh can't stay here. Yeh must come on." He said more, but much of it could not be understood.
  <lb/>He started rapidly forward, with his head turned toward the men. "Come on," he was shouting. The men stared with blank and yokel-like eyes at him. He was obliged to halt and retrace his steps. He stood then with his back to the enemy and delivered gigantic curses into the faces of the men. His body vibrated from the weight and force of his imprecations. And he could string oaths with the facility of a maiden who strings beads.
  <lb/>The friend of the youth aroused. Lurching suddenly forward and dropping to his knees, he fired an angry shot at the persistent woods. This action awakened the men. They huddled no more like sheep. They seemed suddenly to. bethink them of their weapons and at once commenced firing. Belabored by their officers they began to move forward. The regiment involved like a cart involved in mud and muddle, started unevenly with many jolts and jerks. The men stopped, now, every few paces to fire and load, and in this manner moved slowly on from trees to trees.
  <lb/>The flaming opposition in their front grew with their advance until it seemed that all forward ways were barred by the thin leaping tongues and off to the right an ominous demonstration could sometimes be dimly discerned. The smoke, lately generated, was in confusing clouds that made it difficult for the regiment to proceed with intelligence. As he passed through each curling mass, the youth wondered what would confront him on the further side.
  <lb/>The cammand went

  <lb/>the lurid lines. Here, crouching and cowering behind some tree<add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_155_z041">s</add>,
  <lb/>the men clung with desperation as if threatened by a wave. They
  <lb/>looked wild-eyed, and as if amazed, at this furious dis-
  <lb/>turbance they had stirred. In the storm, there was an iron-
  <lb/>ical expression of their importance. The faces of the men,
  <lb/>too, <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_155_z008">could be seen</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_155_z007">showed a lack</add> of a certain feeling of responsibility for

  <lb/>the dominant animal failing to remember in the<del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_155_z011">critical</del> 
  <lb/>supreme moments, the forceful causes of various superficial
  <lb/>qualities. The whole affair seemed incomprehensible to many 
  <lb/>of them.
  <lb/>As they halted thus, the <del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_155_z012">youthful</del>lieutenant again began to 
  <lb/>bellow profanely. Regardless of the vindictive threats of the bul-
  <lb/>lets, he went about^ coaxing, berating and bedamning. His lips, that 
  <lb/>were habitually in a soft and child-like curve, were now writhed
  <lb/>into unholy contortions. He swore by all possible dieeities.
  <lb/>"Once, he grabbed Flemingthe youth by the arm. "Come aon, yeh lunk-
  <lb/>head," he roared. "Come on. We'll all git killed if we
  <lb/>stay here. We've o'ny got t' go across that lot. An' then--"
  <lb/>The remainder of his idea disappeared in a blue haze of curses.
  <lb/>Fleming^The youth stretched forth his arm. "Cross there?" His 
  <lb/>mouth was puckered in doubt and awe.
  <lb/>"Cer'ly! Jest 'cross th' lot! We can't stay here," screamed 
  <lb/>the lieutenant. In his frenzyhHe poked his face close to Flemingthe youth
  <lb/>and waved his bandaged hand. "Come on.!" Presently, he 
  <lb/>grappled with him as if for a wrestling bout. It was as if
  <lb/>he planned to drag Flemingthe youth by the ear on to the assault.
  <lb/>The private felt a sudden unspeakable indignation a-
  <lb/>gainst his officer. He wrenched fiercely and shook him off.
  <lb/>"Come on yerself, then," he yelled. There was a bitter 
  <lb/>challenge in his voice.
  <lb/>They galloped together down the regimental front.The<add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_156_z002"/><del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_156_z001"/>

  <lb/>gyrated like tortured savages.

It was a handful
  <lb/>of men splattered into the faces of the enemy. Toward it in
  <lb/>stantly sprang the yellow tongues. A vast quantity of blue smoke
  <lb/>hung before them. A mighty banging made ears valuless.
  <lb/>The youth<del rend="strikethrough pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_156_z014"><add place="above" rend="no-caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_156_z015"> ran like a madman to reach the woods</add></del>
  <lb/>before a bullet could discover him. He ducked his head low
  <lb/>like a foot-ball player.<del rend="strikethrough pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_156_z018"/> In his haste, his eyes almost
  <lb/>closed and the scene was a wild blur. Pulsating saliva
  <lb/>stood at the corners of his mouth.
  <lb/>Within him, as he hurled himself forward, was born a
  <lb/>love, a despairing fondness for this flag which was near
  <lb/>him. It was a creation of beauty and invulnerability. It
  <lb/>was a goddess, radiant, that bended it's form with an im
  <lb/>perious gesture to him. It was a woman, red and white,
  <lb/>hating and loving, that called him with<add place="above" rend="no-caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_156_z022"/> the voice of his hopes.
  <lb/>Because no harm could come to it, he endowed it with
  <lb/>power. He kept near as if it could be a saver of<del rend="strikethrough pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_156_z021"/>
  <lb/>lives and an imploring cry went from his mind.
  <lb/>In the mad scramble, he was aware that the
  <lb/>color-serjeant flinched suddenly as if struck by a blud
  <lb/>geon. He faltered and then became motionless, save
  <lb/>for his quivering knees.
</ab><milestone n="20" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_157"/>

  <lb/>He made a spring and a clutch at the pole. At the same instant, his friend grabbed it from the other side. They jerked at it, stout and furious, but the color-serjeant was dead and the corpse would not relinquish it's trust. For a moment, there was a grim encounter. The dead man, swinging with bended back seemed to be obstinately tugging, in ludicruos and awful ways for the possession of the flag.
  <lb/>It was past in an instant of time. They wrenched the flag furiously from the dead man, and, as they turned again, the corpse swayed forward with bowed head. One arm swung high and the curved hand fell with heavy protest on the friend's unheeding shoulder.

  <lb/>At sight of this tableau, many of the men in blue sprang from behind their covers and made an ungainly dance of joy. Their eyes burned and a hoarse cheer of elation broke from their dry lips.
  <lb/>It had begun to seem to them that events were trying to prove that they were impotent. These little battles had evidently endeavored to demonstrate that the men could not fight well. When on the verge of submission to these opinions, the small duel had showed them that the proportions were not impossible, and by it they had revenged themselves upon their misgivings and upon the foe.
  <lb/>The impetus of enthusiasm was theirs again. They gazed about them with looks of uplifted pride, feeling new trust in the grim, always-confident weapons in their hands. And they were men.

  <lb/>On a slope to the left, there was a long row of guns, 
  <lb/>gruff and maddened, denouncing the enemy who down through
  <lb/>the woods were forming for another attack in the pitiless 
  <lb/>monotony of conflicts. The round, red discharges from the guns
  <lb/>made a crimson flare and a high, thick smoke. Occasional
  <lb/>glimpses could be caught of <del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_174_z015">the</del>groups of the toiling artillerymen.

  <lb/>a long railing, were tugging frenziedly at their bridles. Men
  <lb/>were running hither and thither.
  <lb/>The <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_174_z012">se</del> detached battle between the four regiments lasted
  <lb/>for some time.There chanced to be no interference and they 
  <lb/>settled their dispute by themselves. They struck savagely and

  <lb/>dark, blue lines, shouting. Fleming could see the two flags
  <lb/>shaking and laughing amid the smoke-remnants.
  <lb/>Presently, there was a stillness, pregnant with meaning.

  <lb/>But at one part of the line there was a grim and

  <lb/>were settled firmly down behind posts and rails. A

  <lb/>The blue whirl of men got very near until it

  <lb/>Those in advance of the scampering blue men,

</ab><milestone n="24" unit="chapter"/><pb facs="#ms_183"/>
<ab>
  <lb/>lost was in his eyes, as he glanced back at them.
  <lb/>The youth's friend went over the obstruction in a tumbling heap and sprang at the flag as a panther at prey. He pulled at it, and wrenching it free, swung up it's red brilliancy with a mad cry of exultation even as the color-bearer, gasping, lurched over in a final throe and stiffening convulsively turned his dead face to the ground. There was much blood upon the grass-blades.
  <lb/>At the place of success there began more wild clamorings of cheers. The men gesticulated and bellowed in an ecstasy. When they spoke it was as if they considered their listener to be a mile away. What hats and caps were left to them, they often slung high in the air.
  <lb/>At one part of the line, four men had been swooped upon and they now sat as prisoners. Some blue men were about them in an eager and curious circle. The soldiers had trapped strange birds and there was an examination. A flurry of fast questions was in the air.
  <lb/>One of the prisoners was nursing a superficial wound in the foot. He cuddled it, baby-wise, but he looked up from it often to curse with an astonishing utter abandon straight at the noses of his captors. He consigned them to red regions; he called upon the pestilential wrath of strange gods. And with it all he was singularly free from recognition of the finer points of the conduct of prisoners-of-war. It was as if a clumsy clod had trod upon his tender toe and he concieved it to be his privelege, his duty, to use deep, resentful oaths.
  <lb/>Another, who was a boy in years, took his plight with great calmness and apparent good-nature. He conversed with the men in blue, studying their faces with his bright and

They spoke of battles and conditions. There was 
  <lb/>an acute interest in all their faces during this exchange of 
  <lb/>view-points. It seemed a great satisfaction to hear voices 
  <lb/>from where all had been darkness and speculation.
  <lb/>The third captive sat with a morose countenance.
  <lb/>He preserved a stoical and cold attitude. To all advances,
  <lb/>he made one reply, without variation. "<subst facs="#ms_184_z002"><del rend="overwrite ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_184_z002">O</del><add place="inline" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_184_z002">A</add></subst>h, go t' hell."

<lb/>They tramped slowly back over the field across which they

<lb/>to the cudgel. He had foolishly squirmed.
<lb/>But the sky would forget. It was true, he admitted,
<lb/>that in the world it was the habit to cry devil at persons who
<lb/>refused to trust what they could not trust, but he thought
<lb/>that perhaps the stars dealt differently. The imperturbable
