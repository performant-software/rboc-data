	<lb/>Presently, men were running hither and thither, in 
	<lb/>all ways. The artillery booming, forward, rearward, and 
    <lb/>on the flanks made jumble of ideas of direction. Land-

    <lb/>was livid and his eyes were rolling uncontrolled. He was heaving and panting. He still grasped his rifle, perhaps
