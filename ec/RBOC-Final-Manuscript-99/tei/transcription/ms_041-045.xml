  <lb/>lage street at home before the arrival of the circus-parade on
  <lb/>a day in the spring. He remembered how he had stood, a
  <lb/>small thrillful boy, prepared to follow the dingy lady upon
  <lb/>the white horse or the band in it's faded chariot. He saw
  <lb/>the yellow road, the lines of expectant people, and the sober
  <lb/>houses. He particularly remembered an old fellow who used
  <lb/>to sit upon a cracker-box in front of the store and
  <lb/>fiegn to dispise such exhibitions. A thousand details of
  <lb/>color and form surged in his mind. The <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_041-045_z003">form of the</del>
  <lb/>old fellow upon the cracker. box appeared in mid-
  <lb/>dle prominence.
  <lb/>Some one cried: "Here they come!"
  <lb/>There was rustling and muttering among the men.
  <lb/>They displayed a feverish desire to have every possible car-
  <lb/>tridge ready to their hands. The boxes were pulled ar-
  <lb/>ound into various positions and adjusted with great
  <lb/>care. It was as if seven hundred new bonnets were being
  <lb/>tried on.
