  <lb/>give him. He had a conviction that he would soon feel in his sore

  <lb/>He made vague plans to go off into the deeper dark-
  <lb/>ness and hide, but they were all destroyed by the voices of 
  <lb/>exhaustion and pain from his body. His ailments, clamoring, 
  <lb/>forced him to seek the place of food and rest, at whatever 
  <lb/>cost.

  <lb/>forms of men throwing black shadows in the red light and

  <lb/>called out: "Why, hello, Wilson, you--you here?"
  <lb/>The rifle <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_112_z010">b</del>was lowered to a position of caution and
