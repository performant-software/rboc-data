  <lb/>went calmly on through fields and woods. Fleming looked at
  <lb/>the men nearest him and saw, for the most part, express-
  <lb/>ions of deep interest as if they were investigating something
  <lb/>that <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z001">was</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z002">had</add> fascinated them. One or two stepped with over-val-
  <lb/>iant airs as if they were already plunged into war. Others
  <lb/>walked <add place="inline" rend="no-caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z052">as</add> upon thin ice. The greater part of the untested men
  <lb/>appeared quiet and absorbed. They were going to look
  <lb/>at war, the red animal, war, the <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z003">blood</del>blood-swollen
  <lb/>god. And they were <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z004">curious.</del>deeply engrossed in this march.
  <lb/>As he looked, <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_034_z006">Fleming</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_034_z005">the youth</add> gripped his out-cry <metamark place="inline" function="paraph" rend="ink" change="mStC" facs="#ms_034_z009">at</metamark> his
  <lb/><del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z007">lips</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z008">throat</add>. He saw that even if the men were tottering with fear,
  <lb/>they would laugh at his warning. They would jeer him and
  <lb/>if practicable pelt him with missiles. Admitting that he
  <lb/>might be wrong, a frenzied declamation of the kind would turn him into a worm.
  <lb/>He assumed, then, the demeanor of one who knows that <add place="above" rend="caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z034">he</add> is
  <lb/>doomed, alone, to unwritten responsibilities. He lagged, with
  <lb/>tragic glances at the sky. He <add place="above" rend="caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z010">was</add> surprised, presently, by the
  <lb/>youthful lieutenant of his company who <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z016">began to</del><add place="above" rend="caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z042">began heartily to</add> beat
  <lb/>him <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z022">heartily</del> with <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_034_z020">his</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_034_z021">a</add> sword, <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z043">and called</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z017">calling</add> out in a loud
  <lb/>and insolent voice. "Come, Fleming, get up into ranks
  <lb/>there. No skulking<del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_034_z045">wi</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_034_z044">'</add>ll do here." He mended his
  <lb/>pace <del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z024">P</del>with <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z025">the</del> <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z026">alcrity</del>suitable haste. And he hated
  <lb/>the lieutenant, who had no appreciation of fine <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z027">things</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z028">minds</add>. He was a mere brute.
  <lb/>After a time, the brigade was halted in the cath-
  <lb/>edral-light of a forest. The busy skirmishers were
  <lb/>still popping. Through the aisles of the wood could be
  <lb/>seen the floating smoke from their rifles. Sometimes it
  <lb/>went up in little balls, <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z029">roun</del>white and compact.
  <lb/><del rend="overwrite pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z046">E</del>During this halt, <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z030">each</del>many men in the regiment
  <lb/>began erecting tiny hills in front of them. They used stones,
  <lb/><add place="margin-left" rend="no-caret pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z051">sticks</add>, earth and anything they thought might turn a <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_034_z031">battl</del>bullet.
  <lb/>Some built comparatively large ones while others seemed
  <lb/>content with little ones.
