  <lb/>wings drearily near to the ground and refused to rise 
  <lb/>on any wings of hope. The men's faces grew doleful

  <lb/>that they were bewildered by the alleged news and could 
  <lb/>not fully comprehend a defeat.
  <lb/>Before the grey mists had been totally obliterated
  <lb/>by the sun-rays, the regiment was marching in a spread 
  <lb/>column that was retiring carefully through the woods. The 
  <lb/>disordered, hurrying lines of the enemy could sometimes 
  <lb/>be seen down through the groves and little fields.
  <lb/>They were yelling, shrill and exultant.
