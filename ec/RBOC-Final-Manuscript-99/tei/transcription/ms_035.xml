  <lb/>Some wished to fight like duellists, believing <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_035_z034">it</add> to be cor-
  <lb/>rect to stand erect <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_035_z003">look</del>and be, from their feet to their 
  <lb/>fore-heads, a mark. They said they scorned the devices 
  <lb/>of the cautious. But th<subst facs="#ms_035_z004"><del rend="overwrite ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_035_z004">ey</del><add place="inline" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_035_z004"/></subst> others scoffed in reply and 
  <lb/>pointed to the veterans on the flanks who <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_035_z005">no s</del> were dig-
  <lb/>ging at the ground like terriers. <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_035_z036">Also, they indicated a </del>

  <lb/>barricade along the regimental front. Directly however they 
  <lb/>were ordered to withdraw from that place.
  <lb/>This astounded <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_035_z007">Flemming</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_035_z006">the youth</add>. He forgot his stewing 
  <lb/>over the advance movement. "Well, then, what did they march 
  <lb/>us out here f<subst facs="#ms_035_z009"><del rend="overwrite ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_035_z009">e</del><add place="inline" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="mStE" facs="#ms_035_z009"/></subst>r?" he demanded of <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_035_z011">Jim Conklin</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStC" facs="#ms_035_z010">the tall soldier</add>. The latter with 
  <lb/>calm faith began a heavy explanation although he had 
  <lb/>been compelled to leave a little protection of stones and 
  <lb/>dirt <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_035_z012">which</del>to which he <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_035_z013">had</add> devoted much care and skill.
  <lb/>When the regiment was aligned in another pos-
  <lb/>ition each man's regard for his safety caused another

  <lb/>behind a third one. They were moved from this one also. 
  <lb/>They were marched from place to place with apparent aimlessness.

  <lb/>of the general<add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_035_z022">s</add>. He began to complain to <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_035_z023">Jim Conklin</del>. <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_035_z024">the tall soldier</add>. <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_035_z025">Oh, I </del>
