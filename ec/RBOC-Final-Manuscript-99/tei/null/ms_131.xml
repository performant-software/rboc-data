  <lb/>Beside<del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_131_z035">,</del> a faith in himself had secretly blossomed. 
  <lb/>There was a little flower of confidence growing 
  <lb/>within him. He was now a man of experience. 
  <lb/>He had been out among the dragons, he said, and 
  <lb/>he assured himself that they were not so hideous 
  <lb/>as he had imagined them. Also, they were inac-
  <lb/>curate; they did not sting with precision. A stout 
  <lb/>heart often defied; and, defying, escaped .
  <lb/>And, furthermore, <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_131_z032">why</del>how could they kill 
  <lb/>him who was the chosen of gods and doomed to 
  <lb/>greatness.
  <lb/>He remembered how some of the men had run
  <lb/>from <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_131_z010">their</del>the battle. As he recalled their terror-
  <lb/>struck faces he felt a scorn for them. They had 
  <lb/>surely been more fleet and more wild than was 
  <lb/>absolutely necessary. They were weak mortals. As for 
  <lb/>himself, he had fled with discretion and dignity.
  <lb/>He was aroused from this reverie by <del rend="multistrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_131_z016">Wilson</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_131_z017">his friend</add>
  <lb/>who having hitched about nervously and blinked at the 
  <lb/>trees for a time, suddenly coughed in an introductory 
  <lb/>way, and spoke.
  <lb/>"Fleming! "
  <lb/>"What?"

  <lb/>again. He fidgeted in his jacket.
  <lb/>"Well," he gulped, at last, "I guess yeh might 
  <lb/>as well give me back them letters." Dark, prickling 
  <lb/>blood had flushed into his <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_131_z024">faces</del>cheeks and brow.
  <lb/>"All right, Wilson," said  <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_131_z025">Fleming</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_131_z026">the youth</add>.

  <lb/>loosened two buttons of his coat, thrust in his hand 
  <lb/>and brought forth the <subst facs="#ms_131_z036"><del rend="overwrite ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_131_z036">o</del><add place="inline" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_131_z036">packet</add></subst>.
