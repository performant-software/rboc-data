  <lb/>the sore badge of his dishonor through life. With his heart
  <lb/>continually assuring him that he was despicable, he could not
  <lb/>exist without making it, through his actions, apparent to all men .
  <lb/>If the army had gone gloriously on, he would be<del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_095_z010">indeed</del>

  <lb/>successful life.
  <lb/>As these thoughts went rapidly through his mind, he turned
  <lb/>upon them and tried to thrust them away. He denounced him-
  <lb/>self as a villain. He said that he was the most unutterably
  <lb/>selfish man in existence. His mind pictured the soldiers who
