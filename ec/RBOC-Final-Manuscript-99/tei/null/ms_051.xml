He experienced the joy of a man who at last finds
  <lb/>leisure in which to look about him.
  <lb/>Under foot, there were a <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z005">few</add> ghastly forms, motionless.
  <lb/>They lay twisted <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z002">into</del>in fantastic contortions. Arms were
  <lb/>bended and heads were turned in incredible ways. It seemed
  that the dead men must <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z007">have</add> fallen from some great height
  <lb/>to get into such positions. They looked <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z018">thrown</del> <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z019">to be</add> dumped
  <lb/>out upon the ground from the sky.
  <lb/>From a position in the rear of the grove a bat-
  <lb/>tery was throwing shells over <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z047">their heads</del> <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z048">it. The flash</add> of the guns startled

  <lb/>Through the trees, he watched the black figures of the gunners
  as they <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z016">hastened</del> worked swiftly and intently. Their labor seemed
  <lb/>a complicated thing. He wondered how they could remember it's formulate
  <lb/>in the midst of confusion.
  <lb/>The guns squatted in a row like savage chiefs. They
  <lb/>argued with abrupt violence. It was a grim pow-wow. Their
  busy servants ran hither and <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z026">there.</del> <add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z028">thither.</add>
  <lb/>A small procession of wounded men were going
  <lb/><add place="margin-left" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z028">drearily</add> toward the rear. It was a flow of blood from the <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z030">wounded</del> <add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z031">torn</add>
  <lb/> body of the brigade.
  <lb/>To the right and <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z051">left w</del> to the left were the dark lines
  <lb/>of other troops. Far in front, he <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z055">could</del> thought he could see
  lighter masses protruding in points from the forest. They were
  <lb/>suggestive of unnumbered thousands.Once he saw a tiny battery go dashing along the line of the horizon.

  <lb/>tiny horses.
  <lb/>From a sloping hill came the sound of cheering<add place="inline" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_051_z050">s</add> and 
  <lb/>clashes. Smoke welled slowly through the leaves.
  <lb/>Batteries were speaking with thunderous oratorical ef-
  <lb/>fort. Here and there were flags, the red in the stripes dominating. They splashed bits of warm color upon the dark lines of troops.
