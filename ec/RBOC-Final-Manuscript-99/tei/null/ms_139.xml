  <lb/>"There's too much chin-music an' too little

  <lb/>A single rifle flashed in a thicket before the regiment. 
  <lb/>In an instant, it was joined by many others. There was

  <lb/>hesitation denoted in the attitudes of the men. They were

  <lb/>much. They <del rend="overwrite ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_139_z024">t</del>rolled their eyes <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_139_z023">strangley</del>toward the ad-

  <lb/>This <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z008">of</del>advance of the enemy had seemed to <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z010">Fleming</del><add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z009">the youth</add> like a

  <lb/>He <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z014">stamped</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z013">beat</add> his foot <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z015">upon the ground</add> and scowled with hate at the swirling smoke 
  <lb/>that was approaching like a phantom flood. There was a mad
  <lb/>dening <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z016">There</del>quality in this seeming resolution of the foe to 
  <lb/>give him no rest, to give him no time to sit down and think. Yesterday, he had fought and had fled rapidly. There many<add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z019">had been</add> 
  <lb/><del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z020">many</del> adventures. For to-day he felt that he had earned op
  <lb/>portunities for contemplative repose. He could have enjoyed 
  <lb/>portraying to unitiated <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z021">spe</del>listeners various scenes at which he
  <lb/>had been a witness, or, <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z022">t</del>ably discussing the processes of 
  <lb/>war with other proven men. Too, it was important that he 
  <lb/>should <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z023">have</add> time for physical recuperation. He was sore and stiff 
  <lb/>from his experiences. He had <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z024">had</del><add place="above" rend="no-caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z025">recieved</add> his fill of all exertions and he wished to rest.
  <lb/>But those other men seemed never to grow weary; they
  <lb/>were fighting with their old speed. He had a wild hate for the <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z027">rl</del>relentless foe. Yesterday, when he had imagined the un
  <lb/>iverse to be against him, he had hated it, little gods and big 
  <lb/>gods; to-day he hated the army of the foe with the same great hatred. He was not going to be badgered of his life like a 
  <lb/>kitten chased by boys, he said. It was not well to drive men into 
  <lb/>final corners; at those moments, they could all develop teeth 
  <lb/>and claws.
  <lb/>He leaned<del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z028">over</del>, and spoke into <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z029">Wilson's</del><add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_140_z030">his friend's</add> ear.
