  <lb/>accepted the matter. And they mused upon it, with a if hun-
  <lb/>dred varieties of expression. It was an interesting engrossing 
  <lb/>thingd to think about. Many tightened their belts carefully

  <lb/>A moment later, the officers began to bustle among the
  <lb/>men, pushing them into a more compact mass and into a
  <lb/>better alignment. They chased those that straggled and fumed at a 
  <lb/>few men who did seemed to show by their attitudes, that they had decided to re-
  <lb/>main at that spot. They were like critical sheperds strug-

  <lb/>near them said in a meek voice: "We'll git swallered."
