  <lb/>it hurts-hurts a good deal," he replied. There was a 
  <lb/>faltering in his voice.
  <lb/>"Oh," said Simpson. He linked his arm in Fleming's and 
  <lb/>drew him forward. "Come on, Flem. I'll take keer <subst facs="#ms_114_z003"><del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_114_z003">of</del><add place="above" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_114_z003">'a</add></subst> yeh."

  <lb/>Fleming's senses were so deadened that Wilson's voice 
  <lb/>sounded from afar and he could scarcely feel the
