In the clouded haze, men became
  <lb/>panic-stricken with the thought that the regiment had lost it's
  <lb/>path and was proceeding in a perilous direction. Once, the men
  <lb/>who headed the wild procession turned and came pushing back
  <lb/>against their comrades screaming that they were being <add place="above" rend="caret ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_161_z002">fired</add> upon from
  <lb/>points which they had considered to be toward their own

  <lb/>the regiment into a wise little band that would proceed calmly
  <lb/>amid the huge-appearing difficulties, suddenly sank down and
  <lb/>buried his face in his arms with an air of bowing to a doom.
  <lb/>From another, a shrill lamentation rang out filled with
  <lb/>profane illusions to a general. Men ran hither and thither
  <lb/>seeking with their eyes, <del rend="strikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_161_z021">way</del> roads of escape. With serene
  <lb/>regularity as if controlled by a schedule, bullets buffed into men.

  <lb/>The officers labored like politicians to beat the

  <lb/>ground was uneven and torn. The men curled
  <lb/>into depressions and fitted themselves snugly behind
  <lb/>whatever would frustrate a bullet.
