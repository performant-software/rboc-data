  <lb/>Presently, he proceeded again on his forward way. The 
  <lb/>battle was like the grinding of an immense and terrible ma-

  <lb/>it's grim processes, fascinated him. He must go close 
  <lb/>and see it produce corpses.
  <lb/>He came to a fence and clambered over it. On 
  <lb/>the far side, the ground was littered with clothes and guns. 
  <lb/>A newspaper, folded up, lay in the dirt. A dead sol-
  <lb/>dier was stretched with his face hidden in his arm. Fur-

  <lb/>He came finally to a road from which he could see

  <lb/>fringed. In the l<subst facs="#ms_069_z026"><del rend="overwrite ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_069_z026">i</del><add place="inline" rend="ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_069_z026">a</add></subst>ne, was a blood-stained crowd streaming

  <lb/>musketry was mingled red cheers. And from this region 
  <lb/>of noises came the steady current of the maimed.
  <lb/>One of the wounded men had a shoeful of blood. He hopped like
  <lb/>a school boy in a game. He was laughing hysterically.
