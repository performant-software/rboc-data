  <lb/>There was something curious in this little intent pause of
  <lb/>the lieutenant.

  <lb/>He was engrossed in this contemplation, and the soft under-
  <lb/>lip <del rend="doublestrikethrough pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_162_z072">tr</del> quivered from self-whispered words.
  <lb/>Some lazy and ignorant smoke curled slowly. The
  <lb/>men, hiding from the bullets, waited anxiously for them
  <lb/>to lift and disclose <del rend="strikethrough pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_162_z073">to them their</del> the plight of the regiment.
  <lb/>The silent ranks were suddenly thrilled by the eager 
  <lb/>voice of the youthful lieutenant bawling out: "Here they come!
  <lb/>Right onto us, b'Gawd." His further words were lost in a
  <lb/>roar of wicked thunder from the men's rifles.

  <lb/>features. There was a recognition as he looked <del rend="doublestrikethrough pencil" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_162_z077">V</del> at the
