  <lb/>The unceasing skirmish-fire encreased to a long

  <lb/>They were pursued by the sound of musketry fire. After a time,
  <lb/>the hot dangerous flashes of the rifles were visible. Smoke-clouds
  <lb/>went slowly and insolently across the fields, like observant
  <lb/>phantoms. The din became crescendo like the roar of an 
  <lb/>oncoming train.
  <lb/>A brigade ahead of them and on the right went into
  <lb/>action with a rending roar. It was as if <del rend="doublestrikethrough ink" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_037_z026">he</del>it had ex-
