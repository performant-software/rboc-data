  <lb/>he said calmly.
  <lb/>"'As far as you could'? Did you, b'Gawd?" snorted the other.
  <lb/>"Well, that wasn't very far, was it?" he added with <add place="above" rend="caret" hand="#SC" change="mStB" facs="#ms_169_z009">(<metamark place="inline" function="caret" rend="ink" change="mstX" facs="#ms_169_z034">^</metamark>a)</add> glance of
  <lb/>cold contempt into the other's eyes. "Not very far, I think. You
  <lb/>were intended to make a diversion in favor of Whiterside.  How 
  <lb/>well you succeeded, your own ears can now tell you." He wheeled
  <lb/>his horse and rode stiffly away.

  <lb/>general, or what--if he says th' boys didn't put up a good
  <lb/>fight out there, he's a damned fool."
  <lb/>"Lieutenant," began the colonel, severely, "this is my own
  <lb/>affair and I'll trouble you--"
  <lb/>The lieutenant made an obedient gesture. "All right, colonel,
